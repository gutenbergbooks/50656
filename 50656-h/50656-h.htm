<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">It</span> is perhaps matter for just surprise that English
literature has been so little enriched during the last
quarter of a century by archivic researches in Italy.
While these studies have greatly modified the views
of Italian historians, it may be safely said that, with
few exceptions, English history of Italy remains substantially
as it was in 1840. The conspiracy of
Gianluigi Fieschi, now presented to the English reading
public, is one of those works which strongly mark the
progress of historical research in the Italian Peninsula;
and though it treats of an episode, that episode is so
woven into the great events which surrounded it as to
give a vivid picture of the condition of Italy in the
sixteenth century. The work has therefore seemed to
me to have sufficient historical value to merit translation
into our language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span></p>

<p>I have been more influenced, however, by a desire to
make some of those who read only English acquainted
with an Italian author who seems to me entitled to a
larger public than his own people. There is no good
reason why a greater number of Italian writers should
not be favoured with an English dress; and it is
probably more the effect of accident than want of
merit in Italian writers that their works are much
more rare in our tongue than those of French and
German authors. The younger historical writers of
the time, to which class M. Celesia belongs, have
peculiar claims upon our attention, because they are the
first truly independent writers of the Peninsula, and
their works are the first fruits of liberal institutions and
a Free Press. It would be only a first homage to their
worth and sincere devotion to liberal principles to
translate their best works into our language rather than
absorb the substance of them into our own books. This
reasoning has induced me to turn aside for a little while
from the labour of preparing a history of Genoa to
render M. Celesia’s beautiful Italian into an English,
which I freely confess to be imperfect in comparison
with the original.</p>

<p>The first impression of the general reader may be
that this book treats of events so distant in time, and
so different in moral scenery, from the political and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
social conditions in which we live as to afford little or
no instruction to us. No history, except that of one’s
own country, affords precise forms in which to mould
the present; and what are called historical parallels do
not really exist, since every series of political events
has peculiar elements which make close analogies with
any other series impossible. Those who quote events
in the history of other times and peoples as containing
precise instruction for present national action usually
deceive their auditors all the more completely from
being deceived themselves. It is only in the abundant
matter of general principles that history contains lessons
of political wisdom. In this sense the work before the
reader is not without valuable instruction. M. Celesia
has given us a view of the social and political condition
of the masses who have too often been excluded from
history because they had been excluded from power in
the state.</p>

<p>We see, in fact, some painful scenes of that long
tragedy which ended in the disfranchisement of the
Italians, in the very period when most other European
nations were making the bases of their institutions
broader by enlarging the liberties of their peoples; and
we see clearly that two vast despotisms&mdash;one reposing
on a fiction of the continued life of the Roman Empire
and the other on a perversion of the principle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
Christian Authority&mdash;conspiring now together, now
against each other, bewildered the intellect and destroyed
the political vitality of Italy, gradually reducing
her to a mere geographical expression. The people
struggled in vain, partly because they struggled blindly,
partly because a pernicious error placed them in
exceptional conditions by stripping them of a part of
their rights avowedly in the interest of humanity at
large. So far this struggle was peculiar in form; but
at bottom it was a struggle for popular rights, and its
disastrous close is here shown to have been due to no
fault of the people themselves. It is just here that less
than justice has been done to the Italians, and this
work well illustrates the stupendous falsehood which
slew them.</p>

<p>Our interest in this error might be less if it were
dead; but it lives and embarasses the Italians of our
own day. We have just been gravely informed by a
French statesmen<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that Rome does not belong to Italy,
but to the whole catholic world; and the statement is a
key not only to current Italian difficulties but also to the
failure of the nation to keep pace with the rest of
Europe in the sixteenth century. Then, more than
now, other nations conceived themselves to have a
mission to preserve institutions which Italy was disposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
to condemn and abolish. Then a larger number
of Italians than now were bewildered by the legal or
historical claim set up for a dead Empire and a
Christian Church founded upon force, and in their
bewilderment went over to their enemies. But below
all this, a brave people struck manful blows for their
salvation, and when they fell were suffocated with the
terrible doctrine that Italy does not belong to herself.
The statement of Count Persigny was and is, in its
political significance, when applied to Italian politics,
exactly like a declaration that London does not belong
to England or Paris to France.</p>

<p>I do not forget that the falsehood has been acted
upon as a truth in Italy for some centuries; but
political piracy cannot win the moral approval of our
times on the plea that it has been practised for a long
period. The real effect of the doctrine, whatever be
its force from a history made by applying it, is to
condemn a whole people to a certain dependence on
other nations, to give France, Austria and Spain&mdash;or to
go back to the sixteenth century, France and the
Empire&mdash;rights or duties in Italy which must impair
the rights of the Italians. A creed which has this fatal
element may be pushed to its logical consequence&mdash;the
assassination of a nation. In the sixteenth century
this was done. It was cruel&mdash;too cruel to be described&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
history accused the fallen of cowardice, incapacity
for liberty and superstitious devotion to Rome.
From such atrocious slanders, the Italians of the
sixteenth century deserve a vindication. M. Celesia
has felt this part of his office so warmly that his word
may seem those of an advocate rather than of an
historian to those who forget the wrongs done to his
people in the name of history. But he who fully
weighs the injustice against which our author protests
will rather wonder at the moderation and critical
calmness of the greater part of the book than complain
of the glow of honest indignation which lights up some
of his periods.</p>

<p>The critical reader will regret that the work is not
fortified by more copious references. The truth is that
it is not the fashion in Italy to quote authorities, and
the citations given were prepared by the author for this
edition. I have added a few explanatory foot-notes;
but the reader is referred for fuller information regarding
events in earlier Genoese history to a forthcoming
work on that subject.</p>

<p class="pn2 reduct">CATILINE AND FIESCHI COMPARED.&mdash;CATILINE’S AIMS OF A GENEROUS
CHARACTER.&mdash;FIESCHI SOUGHT TO FREE HIS COUNTRY FROM THE
SPANISH YOKE.&mdash;HISTORY UNJUST TO THE VANQUISHED.&mdash;SOURCES OF
THIS HISTORY.&mdash;MATERIALS FOR THE FUTURE HISTORIAN OF ITALY.</p>

<p class="pn2"><span class="smcap">It</span> would be difficult to find in the history of the
sixteenth century a name more fiercely assailed than
that of Gianluigi Fieschi. From Bonfadio down to
the most recent historians, the Count of Lavagna has
received the same treatment at the hands of our writers
which the learned vulgar are accustomed to give to
Catiline. This levity of judgment is a new proof that
history is too high a pursuit for servile minds.</p>

<p>The classic invectives of Cicero and the glittering
falsehoods of Sallust, both written with masterly
eloquence, and their echo taken up by inferior writers
have disfigured the manly form of Sergius, and his
cause, supported by the most generous and cultivated
Romans, has come down to us described as the base
plot of abandoned men.</p>

<p>Catiline could not have been base. He was illustrious
by birth, well-known for his talents and powerful
on account of his numerous dependants and friends.
He stood on the last round of the ladder leading to the
consulship and was supported by knights and senators;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
by Antonius Geta, Lentulus, Cethegus and even by
Cæsar who was no stranger to the conspiracy. Crassus
favoured him, though he afterwards turned informer
against the conspirators. Entire colonies and Municipalities
supported him. In upper Spain, Gneus Piso,
in Mauritania, Publius Sittius Nucerinus and the
legions were his partisans; in fine, he was the head of
all the reformers of Italy and Gaul.</p>

<p>I do not excuse his violence, his disorderly life and
his vices; though we know of these only through his
enemies. But his aims were unquestionably high and
noble. Roman liberty was buried in his tomb and not
even the dagger of Junius Brutus could recall her to
life. I hold it incontestable that the movement, far
from being a plot of reckless men, was general and
spontaneous towards that freedom which Lucius Sylla
had extinguished in blood; a movement for which
there was crying urgency in Italy, where crowds of
slaves were supplanting the Latin races, and throughout
the dominions of the Republic. In vain have cunning
rhetoricians taught us to execrate the name of the great
Roman, the last of the Tribunes. He has left for
history a page written with his own blood which is
more lasting than all envy. It shows us one who fell
dead on the same ground where he steadfastly fought,
displaying in his last hour an heroism which is inconsistent
with the crimes coupled with his name.</p>

<p>Cicero himself tells us that the friendship of Catiline
had such fascinations that he had barely escaped its
influence. It may be true that his pallid face, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>
fierce eyes and his nervous step, now quick, now slow,
terrified the publicans and patricians of Rome; but none
can believe that he butchered his own son, immolated
victims to the silver eagle of Marius, or handed round
in nocturnal conventicles a cup full of foaming blood.
Catiline was a bad man because he was vanquished;
but Salvator Rosa, the soldier and painter of Masaniello,
when he drew Catiline as a stern and magnanimous
man did not believe him a low plotter, and the great
captain of our century declared that he preferred the
part of the great Latin conspirator to that of the
versatile Tully.</p>

<p>The character of the Count of Lavagna has been
depicted in similar colours by servile writers skilful in
inventing calumnies. Catiline and Fieschi had the
same ambition and a common aim. The former, in
his familiar letters to Lentulus which were published
in the Senate, declared that no venal ambition led him
to make war. He said that his estates were security
for his debts and that the liberality and wealth of
Orestilla and his daughter would provide for any
deficiency. He averred, he was impelled by wrongs
and slanders, that he made the cause of the unfortunate
his own, because he was defrauded of the fruit of his
labours, and, while he was falsely suspected, was forced
to see base men taking his place.</p>

<p>The same is true of Fieschi, whose death, Gianettino
Doria had sworn. In Genoa, not less than in Rome, a
partisan contest between the nobles and the people had
lasted for centuries. Here, after the civil conflagrations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
as after the scourgings of Rome by Marius and Sylla,
liberty gradually expired. In both Republics, the
people were bowed down by the insolence of the great.
They were deprived of all share in the government, and
corrupt ambition had unbounded sway. In Liguria,
Andrea Doria had completed the triumph of the party
of the nobles and imperialists and the ruin of popular
liberty. Though he forbore to assume a princely title,
he was a true king in authority, his nephew aspired to
regal honours, and every popular right was trampled
down by the Spanish power. According to Bonfadio
this subjection was too bitter for the great soul of the
Count Lavagna long to endure the humiliation. But
his enemies wrote, and by a thousand channels circulated,
the most incredible things as parts of his designs:&mdash;That
he attempted by base intrigues to ruin the Republic,
that he aimed to seduce it to servitude to his
family or to France, to exterminate the Doria family,
to lay bloody and felonious hands on the bank of St.
George, to put the city to fire and sack. The decrees
and official reports of the Republic do not warrant such
statements, and a theory more honourable to him is
justified by the gentleness of his character, by the
Guelph traditions of his house, by the fact that he
prevented the murder of Doria, in his palace, and by
the conspiracy itself, the fury of which was directed
against the ships of Doria, sparing those of the
Republic.</p>

<p>It was necessary for Doria that black designs should
be attributed to Fieschi, otherwise his fearful vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
would have been unjustifiable. The slander was profitable
also to the Spanish Cæsar, for it took away from
his path a powerful family opposed to the Aragonese
power in Italy. And as matter of fact, these idle tales,
written in Genoa and diffused in France and Spain,
were never believed among us. The greater part of
the patricians did not credit them for they were
Fieschi’s friends and would have saved him if the
overbearing spirit of Doria had not imposed his will
upon the senate. Such slanders found no credit with
the people, who placed their love upon that philanthropic
family and perpetuated its memory in national
songs.</p>

<p>Catiline and Fieschi intended to awaken in their
native lands the love of expiring liberty, and in that
aim they had the support of many nobles and of the
people. The pride of Roman patricians could bend to
an alliance with the people, but they scorned to share
their rights with foreign slaves. The Count of Lavagna
grasped the hand of the people, but he refused the
alliance of France. This fact testifies for both to the
honesty of their designs; for to a traitor all paths are
good so they but lead to his end.</p>

<p>Catiline, slandered by Cicero upon the rostrum,
fulminates in his turn against his detractor, and though
he quits Rome unattended, his exit is imposing and
momentous. Fieschi, bending to the necessities of his
time, found more quiet and secret paths to his end;
and when accused by the minister of Cæsar with
seeking to foment a revolution, he confronted Andrea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
Doria with a frankness which eluded the Admiral’s
keen vigilance. From the blood of Catiline sprung
the dictatorship of Cæsar; from that of Fieschi, the
oligarchic government and the Spanish dominion in
Genoa.</p>

<p>Doria, becoming the supporter and partisan of
Charles V. and Phillip II. prevented Genoa from
entering into the league of the Italian Republics
against the Spanish yoke. Genoa, united to the enemies
of Florence and Siena in the time of those memorable
sieges, allied with the enemies of Naples when that
people was rising for liberty, the friend of all the
enemies of Italy, dates from that period her unfortunate
decline. The movement of Fieschi, if he had accepted
the alliance of France, might have averted the catastrophe.
The French and Republican league might
have extirpated the Spanish power in the Peninsula,
and saved Italy from forging her own chains. It might
have spared Genoa her struggles with the Barbary
states, the revolt of the Corsicans, the decline of her
commerce with the East and the most disastrous of all
her civil tumults.</p>

<p>The Genoese people struggled long against that fatal
alliance, cemented with their blood, which Fieschi
strove to break. They left no means untried to dissolve
it, using now supplication, now the sword and the
scaffold. And for more than two centuries, a half
subdued populace never grew weary of pouring its
indignant complaints into the ear of the nobility. I
have compared Catiline and Fieschi. The resemblance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span>
has not escaped historians. But their works and discourses
have been reported, and judged by their enemies
and by the faction which they strove to displace from
power. The name of Count Fieschi waits to be rehabilitated
by time which cancels great wrongs, impartially
dispenses praise and blame, and gives each man that
place in the esteem of posterity which his works merit.</p>

<p>From the earliest times our country was lacerated
by two hostile factions. There were annalists and
writers who recorded and magnified the exploits of
those belonging to their party and silently passed over
the praiseworthy actions of their political opponents.
Procopius and Iornandes represent the two creeds
which in their time were contending for the support of
the nation. Anastaius is the biographer of the Popes,
as Paul Diacono is of the Longobardic kings. In every
province there were Malaspini and Dino Compagni,
imperialists, fighting against the Guelph and Republican
spirit of the three Villani. From the union of these
hostile elements come forth the critical historian of the
nation&mdash;Macchiavelli. But when the Germanic irruption
cut the nerves of the Latin traditions, when
Charles V. and Andrea Doria reestablished the foreign
power in Italy, the Guelph spirit was silenced, the
Journal killed, the Chronicle and official falsehoods
so misrepresented events as to render history nearly
impossible. John Mark Burigozzo, a Lombard shopkeeper,
was the last annalist who recorded the sorrows
of the people. Then came classic, courtly and salaried
historians&mdash;history written by the victors. There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span>
need of great caution in reading the verdict of a history
written with the sword. “Woe to the vanquished” in
history as on the battle-field. Corrupt ages praise
successful crimes, and it is only by great effort that
after times emancipate themselves from these servile
adulations. There is a coward instinct in man which
prompts him to applaud force and despise the fallen.
The conscientious historian should enter his free protest
against such dishonourable acquiescence in forced
verdicts. It is time that history should be relieved
from the tyranny of eloquent but mendacious tongues,
and many powerful ones should be deposed from ill-gotten
thrones. It is time to ask of many who have
been called heroes what use they made of their swords
and how they served Italy, and to concede&mdash;the supreme
right of misfortune&mdash;a tardy tribute of regret to one
who fell victim to a high and generous purpose.</p>

<p>What is the verdict recorded against Fieschi?</p>

<p>Among the writers who were his contemporaries stand
foremost, Bonfadio, Campanaceo, Sigonio, Capelloni,
Foglietta, Mascardi and Casoni. I do not mention
foreigners, first among whom are Tuano and the
Cardinal de Retz. I omit, too, the modern writers, since
they have all followed with the assiduity of copyists the
earlier historians, making no effort to study the public
archives or even to criticise the text which they copied.
Nevertheless, it is important to give the reader some
account of the historians of that epoch; since the first
duty of one who attempts to describe past events is to
employ criticism in its widest sense, and so to separate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span>
the true from the false. Nor can this be done without
carefully weighing the credibility of authors who have
gone this way before us and taking account of the
passions which governed them when they wrote.</p>

<p>The first historian of Fieschi was Bonfadio who was
employed by the senate to write the annals of the
Republic. He was a witness of the events which he
described and on the very night of the rising, he went
to the senate in company with Giovanni Battista
Grimaldi. Yet we can yield him little faith; since,
writing at the command of the government, he could not
do less than speak harshly of the government’s enemies.
He confesses that he had not in his hands the records
of the conspirators’ trial. He ignores many facts, and
never names the accomplices of Fieschi, scarcely suspecting
that there were any. Having a mania for classic
imitation, and borne away by the current of his times,
he depicts Gianluigi as a man thirsting for base
deeds and for blood; so, that if his immortal pages
served to render the memory of Fieschi odious at a
time when men had little concern for the honour of the
vanquished, they are certainly too careless and too
partial to satisfy the future. The unfortunate author,
who was truthful in all other matters and failed in this
only, because it treated of a plot against the powerful
Doria, reaped bitter fruits for his great bias against
Fieschi.</p>

<p>Not less unjust was Giuseppe Mario Campanaceo,
who added to his history of the conspiracy a comparison
between it and that of Catiline. “Both,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span>
says, “sprung from noble stock. Both were crushed
under the ruin they plotted for others. In the one, a
fierce look, a sanguinary countenance; in the other, a
singular beauty and a virginal candour. The Roman
was stained with bloody and licentious deeds; the
Genoese bore the fame of goodness of heart and grace
of manners. The Roman was verging towards age;
the Genoese was in the freshness of his youth, yet he
surpassed the conspirator of the Tiber as much in
deceitfulness as Catiline excelled him in warlike
exploits.”</p>

<p>If on minor points the narration of this writer is
more accurate, it still bears the seal of the degraded
time in which it was written. Though the author
professes to have taken great pains to discover the
truth, having spent a long time in Genoa for that
purpose, it is very easy to see that he did not escape
the contagion of party feeling and of the malevolence
of the faction then dominant in Liguria. It is not
strange, therefore, that he finds a mean and avaricious
spirit in Gianluigi, while he describes Gianettino as an
illustrious victim, rather, as the most virtuous knight
of all Christendom.</p>

<p>Carlo Sigonio, in his life of Andrea Doria, and,
among Genoese writers, Oberto Foglietto have treated
the matter with elegance of diction but with unblushing
plagiarism.</p>

<p>The same may be said of Lorenzo Capelloni, who
described the conspiracy of Fieschi in a report to
Charles V. He was too devoted to Cæsar, and to Doria,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span>
whose life he wrote, not to imitate the others whom
we have mentioned in treating the attempt of Fieschi
as a plot of like character with that of Cybo which he
also described.</p>

<p>Agostino Mascardi, who was more of a rhetorician
than an historian, tells us nothing new. Casoni was
less devoted to the Spanish power and therefore more
humane towards Fieschi, but he adopted without
question the opinion professed by the party in power
who never opened the archives of the state for the
study of the historian.</p>

<p>We therefore conclude that a prudent and impartial
criticism forbids us to give full faith to those who have
given to Count Fieschi a dishonourable place in history.</p>

<p>In our opinion two qualifications are essential to the
historian:&mdash;That he be able to collect the most accurate
accounts of the facts, and that party spirit do not
cloud the serenity of his mind. The writers whom we
have mentioned lack these credentials. In fact, after
studying the annals of the sixteenth century, we are
satisfied that most of them were ignorant of the true
causes of events. Sometimes they knew only a part of
the facts; sometimes, acting under the influence of
personal or political jealousy, they betrayed the truth
by silence, by misrepresentation or by additions of
what would serve their own purposes or the wishes of
their masters.</p>

<p>The reader must judge whether we have truly
balanced the account.</p>

<p>We see, from what has been said, that it was impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span>
Fieschi should have had truthful historians in
the provinces ruled by Charles V. It was not to be
expected in Genoa, where the supreme authority of the
Dorias compelled even the least servile writers to the
most skilful management of conscience and speech.</p>

<p>Neither in Tuscany, where the seeds of the Medicean
tyranny were already springing up; not in Lombardy,
which was the battle-ground of the two opposing
factions; not in the kingdom of Naples tossed like a
foot-ball from one master to another, but at the moment
in the grasp of Cæsar. Finally, not in Rome where the
Spanish government, in its war to the death upon the
spirit of civil and religious liberty, found a swift
accomplice in the Papal court which employed the zeal
and devotion of its inquisitors in consigning to the
flames both books and their authors. It is enough
that no writer in Italy was permitted to answer the
blind devotee of Rome, Baronius.</p>

<p>A few noble spirits arose to tell the truth of the
Austro-Spanish power; such as Bandello, Ariosto,
Boccalini and Tassoni; nevertheless in the period
between Charles V. and the middle of the 17th century
no true light of history shone on the Peninsula.</p>

<p>Learned and literary men lived in the courts, then
the only dispensers of fame, and writers were more
valued for their promptness in serving masters than
for their mental acquirements. Even the best writers
exhausted their ambition in the chase for courtly
favour. It is not true that the protection of princes
was useful to letters and arts; it only seduced them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span>
from the path of duty. Truth was banished from
books because it displeased our masters, and history
was sure to be smothered if it contained more than
panegyric. Spanish wordiness had corrupted liberal
studies and Italians were no longer honestly indignant
against the oppressors of their country. They descended
from employing their imaginations in intellectual
creations to pandering to the senses. Literary entertainments,
like falcons and buffoons, served for the
sport of courtiers, as an instrument of corruption
rather than a stimulant to generous pursuits. Intellect
being thus prostrated, Fieschi could find no historian
courageous enough to clear away the falsehoods that
blackened his fame and constrain his calumniators to
an honest confession. Cybo, Farnese, and whoever else,
following the footsteps of Fieschi, opposed at the price
of their lives Spanish influence, shared the historical
misfortune of the Count of Lavagna.</p>

<p>It was necessary, then, to rewrite this history and
I resolved to attempt the task. There are subjects
(and the conspiracy of Fieschi is one of them) which
seen from a distance fill us with apprehension, but
when we approach and handle them, the alarm which
possessed us generally disappears. I approached my
subject with honest boldness and having studied it
intimately, I have dared to rebel against the common
opinion of the learned. If it were necessary to quote
all the authorities for a conviction so opposed to the
current of corrupted history the list would be too long.
I, therefore appeal to the cultivated who will, I hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span>
bear me witness that very little within the range of the
subject has escaped my notice. I ought, however, to
remark that the Archives of Madrid and Paris have
furnished me with foreign notices of the revolts of
Fieschi and his partisans, and that more perfect information
has been obtained from the Archives of
Genoa, Florence, Parma, Massa and Carrara, and from
some codexes and manuscripts which once belonged to
Cardinal Adriano Fieschi (the last of the Savignone
branch of the Fieschi family) whose heir, Count
Alessandro Negri di S. Front, kindly permitted me to
consult them at my pleasure. I render him my most
hearty thanks. I have drawn other materials from the
writings of the sacred college of Padua in favour of
the Republic and the pleadings of the famous jurists
who sustained the Fieschi party. Many other notices
have been taken from private libraries in Genoa, which
are at once so numerous and so difficult of access.
Some documents very favourable to the cause of Fieschi
were recently published by the erudite Bernardo Brea,
but the greater part of them were already familiar to
me; for the history which I now send to the press was
written several years ago&mdash;a proof of which is that
many extracts from it were then published in the
journals. It is hardly worth while to dwell upon the
reasons which kept me from publishing the work: The
times were not, and are not, propitious to historic
studies; yet I am forced in my own despite to bring
my manuscript to light, lest I be accused of treading
in the footsteps of a great author who has recently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span>
removed many a stain from the name of Fieschi and
lashed his detractors with the severest condemnation.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A modest cultivator of peaceful studies, I do not fear
that any will suspect me of aiming to destroy the
reverence due to a great name; or that I shall receive
the sentence pronounced by Richelieu, who, on reading
the conspiracy of Fieschi written by Cardinal de Retz
in his youth, prophesied that the author would develop
a turbulent and revolutionary spirit.</p>

<p>My humble condition and the honesty of my intentions
render me safe from similar vacticinations.
Though in my opinions upon the conspiracy I depart
from the paths beaten by other writers, it is not
without adequate reasons. I feel that the religion
of truth, has had hitherto too few worshippers, that
reverence for the unfortunate great of Italy has been
long put under ban, and do not hesitate to say that if
what I shall dare to write was not unknown by others
it was most certainly concealed. What were the aims
of Fieschi? What of Andrea Doria? Whither tended
the uprising of the people? Who breathed life into the
cause of national independence? To these questions,
so far as I know, no one has yet made a sufficient
answer; and, indeed, how can one write of Fieschi and
Doria without investigating their personal motives,
prying into the secrets of their hearts? Our historians,
copying each other and compressing the tragedy of a
century into a few pages, have given us only the conspiracy
and the uprising, that is the least philosophic
moment. For us, history begins where the strife ends.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
The designs which animate the combatants do not die
with them, and they expand into the most interesting
questions. Let the writer who does not feel the
greatness of his mission shun these questions, I prefer
that the reader shall not believe me a timorous friend
of truth.</p>

<p>If once terror chained men’s souls, if great names
could not be discussed, to-day, delivered from the
febrile excitements of our predecessors, we may freely
praise and blame the men and deeds of three centuries
ago.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. A general history of Italy remains
to be written, and the materials are scattered in the
archives of our communes. Italy will write it when
she shall have secured independence and a true national
unity. In the meantime, mindful of the saying of
Vico that, “we ought to seek for minute notices of
facts and their antecedents rather than general causes
and events, since by an accurate study of the facts themselves
it becomes easy to find the causes and to clear
up effects which often seem incredible to us,” I have
devoted my utmost strength to removing a portion of
that veil which covers the name of Fieschi, happy if I
am able in this effort to correct some erroneous opinions
and to prepare matter for the future historian of the
nation.</p>

<p class="pp8 p1">“Fra Siestri e Chiavari</p>
<p class="pp4">S’adima la bella fiumana,”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="pn1">retains in our day but little resemblance to the ancient
seat of the Counts of Lavagna. Instead of forts and
castles crowning every gentle elevation, the modern
tourist finds a church dedicated to St. Stephen, and his
eye wanders over hills, swelling above each other
towards the encircling mountains and covered with
olive gardens and orchards. The din of arms, the
clash of maces and shields, is no longer heard; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
instead the ear is saluted with the songs of peaceful
burghers whose humble ambition finds content in
gathering the fruit of the vines, weaving their nets,
and drawing from their famous caves that slate which
covers all the roofs of Liguria.</p>

<p>The banks of that stream which our ancestors called
Entella, and we moderns Lavagna (from the name of
the adjacent commune), have preserved, through the
changes of centuries, their wonderful charms. It rises
in the humble valley of Fontanabuona, is enriched by
numerous tributaries from vales on either hand, and
slips quietly into the sea after a course of only twenty-four
miles.</p>

<p>Some tell us that in ages which have no authentic
history the ancient Libarna was here, and that the
name was afterwards corrupted into Lavagna; but our
modern geographers do not accept the opinion. It is
certain that Lavagna became the seat of a count of
that name, who, about the year one thousand of our
era, ruled over the contiguous districts of Sestri,
Zoagli, Rapallo, Varese, and a great part of Chiavari.
From this epoch, for many centuries, the history of the
whole region was absorbed in that of the great family
who ruled that portion of Liguria. The origin of these
Counts is lost in mediaeval darkness. Giustiniani,
Prierio, Panza, Sansovino, Betussi, and Ciaccone believe
that they came of the stock of the Dukes of Bourgogne
or of the Princes of Bavaria, and they affirm that the
counts were called <span class="smcap">Flisci</span>, because they watched over
the collection of the imperial taxes. On this point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
nothing can be said with certainty. For our part,
remembering that from the time of Otto the Great
four powerful families ruled over all Liguria&mdash;that is
the Counts of Lavagna and Ventimiglia, and the
Marquises of Savona and Malaspina&mdash;we are led to
believe that the Fieschi, like the Estensi, Pallavicini,
Malaspina, and many other powerful houses, had a
Longobardic derivation. This belief is supported by
the fact that the Counts of Lavagna ruled with
Longobardic laws, and drew from that nation,
their Christian names as Oberto, Ariberto, Valperto,
Rubaldo, Sinibaldo, Tebaldo, and others of like
formation, which we find on every page of their
family records. The Longobards ruled almost a
century and a half in Liguria, and it is probable
that many families of that nation founded feuds and
took firm root with their estates and castles.</p>

<p>It is certain that the first count of the name clearly
mentioned in history was a certain Tedisio, son of
Oberto, who ruled the county of Lavagna in 992, and
who had previously accompanied King Arduinus
through all his campaigns. From him descended, in the
right line, Rubaldo, Tedisio II., Rubaldo II., Alberto,
and Ruffino. In the will of Ruffino (1177) the name
Fieschi occurs for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Then followed
Ugone and Tedisio III., brother of Pope Innocent IV.
It is not our purpose to speak of their genealogy, but
we refer the curious reader to works on that subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>The Counts of Lavagna, at a very early period,
enlarged their jurisdiction by acquiring many surrounding
castles and feuds. The growth of their power was
so rapid that the Genoese people, in the earliest days
of the communal system (1008), found it necessary to
put a check on the increasing influence of this family.
The Genoese attempted to take possession of the castle
of Caloso, the first seat of the Fieschi, and then held
by Count San Salvatore. The Fieschi anticipated and
foiled the movement by pushing forward their conquests
so as to include in their dominions Nei, Panesi, Zerli,
and Roccamaggiore. This conflict gave rise to long
and indecisive struggles, which did not end until the
Genoese army, returning from the Romagna in 1133,
marched through Lavagna, dismantled its fortresses,
and, to secure the obedience of the Counts, fortified
Rivarolo, in the very heart of the country. The Counts
rallied from the effects of this staggering blow, and,
by dint of extraordinary address and courage, recovered
their estates and independence.</p>

<p>When Frederick I. besieged Milan, the Fieschi went
to his camp to pay him homage, and the Emperor, by
royal decree, dated the 1st of September, 1158, invested
Count Rubaldo Fieschi with all the ancient lands and
rights of his family.</p>

<p>This patent conferred upon the Counts the following
territories and privileges:</p>

<p>The waters of Lavagna and the tolls (<i>pedaggio</i>) for
the highways along the sea-shore and the road through
the mountains; feudatory rights over the men who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
held allodial properties in the three plebeian hamlets
of Lavagna near the sea, Sestri, and Varese; and
finally the wood which has the following boundaries&mdash;from
the Croce di Lambe to Monte Tomar, thence to
the bridge of Varvo, lake Fercia and Selvasola, returning
to the point of departure at Croce di Lambe.</p>

<p>The Fieschi were thus rendered independent of the
republic, and, about 1170, having made a secret treaty
with Obizzo Malaspina and the counts of Da Passano,
they invested Rapallo, and put Genoa to such straits
that she was forced to ask aid of the marquises of
Monferrato, Gavi, and Bosco. The soldiers of the allies
under the command of Enrico il Guercio, Marquis of
Savona, punished the contumacy and audacity of the
Fieschi.</p>

<p>Finally, to compress much into few words, the
commune of Genoa, on the 25th of June, 1198, made
a treaty with the Counts of Lavagna. The latter
bound themselves to content their ambition with the
possession of Lavagna, Sestri, and Rivarolo, and the
commune conferred many honours and privileges on
the counts, especially reaffirming the rights conveyed
to the family by the Emperor. The Fieschi further
pledged themselves never more to draw sword against
the city of Genoa or her allies, the Bishop of Bobbio,
and the Lords of Gavi, and to become citizens of Genoa.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
At the time of this treaty Count Martino was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
sole head of the whole family, but after his death
they separated into many branches. The principal line
retained the name Fieschi; the others were called
Scorza, Ravaschieri, Della Torre, Casanova, Secchi,
Bianchi, Cogorno, and Pinelli.</p>

<p>It is not our intention to speak further of the junior
branches. The treaty with Genoa marks the close of
the wars between the commune and the Fieschi, and
the beginning of our domestic divisions, which for
centuries weakened the republic, and compelled the
lover of repose to seek it in voluntary exile. Those
who adhered to the empire were called <i>Mascherati</i>,
and the opposite faction <i>Rampini</i>, headed by Fieschi.
It would be a long work and one outside of our
purpose to describe the various changes of fortune
through which the Counts of Lavagna passed, tossing
up and down in the fury of political strife; but it is
noteworthy that they always maintained the character
of defenders of popular liberty.</p>

<p>When Galeazzo Sforza was in power, they lived at
Rome in exile, and their castles were occupied by
ducal garrisons; but after the death (1476) of this
tyrant, they rushed to arms, assailed the ducal palace
in Genoa, and forced Giovanni Pallavicini, governor
under Sforza, to take refuge in the fortress of Castelletto.
Having made themselves masters of the city, far from
assuming supreme powers, they immediately summoned
the great parliament of the citizens who elected eight
captains of liberty, six of whom were taken from the
people and two from the patricians. Giano Giorgio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
and Matteo Fieschi were placed at the head of the
army; but to defend the city from the threatened
invasion a spirit of greater force and audacity was
needed. The eyes of the people fell upon Obietto
Fieschi, who was at Rome a prisoner of Sixtus IV., the
ally of Sforza. He eluded the Pope’s vigilance, put
himself at the head of his own vassals, and fought
long, until, defeated by the imperial forces under
Prospero Adorno, he was forced to take shelter in the
castles of his county. The fortresses of Pontremoli,
Varese, Torriglia, Savignone, and Montobbio were
one after the other wrested from him, and he himself
was captured and conducted to Milan, where, becoming
involved in a plot against the Duchess Bona, he was
detained in prison. His brother, Gianluigi, took his
place and kept alive the fire of liberty. He routed
Giovanni del Conte and Giovanni Pallavicini, in
Rapallo, with terrible slaughter. He afterwards
entered into negociations, and ceded Torriglia and
Roccatagliata to Prospero Adorno.</p>

<p>But the Sforza government had so outraged the
Genoese that popular indignation ran high against it,
and Prospero Adorno resolved to free himself from his
unfortunate alliance, and, to strengthen his new
position, sought and obtained the aid of the counts
of Lavagna. The Lombard regency sent a splendidly
equipped army of more than sixteen thousand men, to
compel the rebels to return to their allegiance; but
Gianluigi Fieschi assaulted them in flank and rear with
such skill and courage that he put them to complete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
rout. The enemy took refuge in Savignone and
Montobbio, but Fieschi refused to listen to terms of
accommodation, stormed those strongholds, recovered
his feuds, and retained the prisoners as a ransom for
Obietto.</p>

<p>The Fieschi may have been restless partisans and
promoters of intestine strife, but they were never
tyrants. Their broad lands, from which they drew
large revenues and considerable armies, enabled them
to make war upon a republic already strong in arms,
and to snatch victory from the troops of foreign lords.
At this period they held in the duchies of Parma and
Piacenza the feuds of Calestano, Vigolone, Pontremoli,
Valdettaro, Terzogno, Albere, Tizzano, Balone, and a
number of smaller castles; in the territory of Lunigiana&mdash;Massa,
Carrara, Suvero, Calice, Vepulli, Madrignano,
Groppoli, Godano, Caranza, and Brugnato; in Valdibubera
they were masters of Varzi, Grimiasco, Torriglia,
Cantalupo, Pietra, and Savignone; in Piedmont&mdash;Vercelli,
Masserano, and Crevacore; in Lombardy&mdash;Voghera
(which Tortona sold to Percival Fieschi in
1303), and Castiglione di Lodi; in Umbria&mdash;Mugnano;
in the kingdom of Naples&mdash;San Valentino; in Liguria,
to say nothing of Lavagna, where they coined money
before 1294,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> they possessed more than a hundred
boroughs.</p>

<p>It should be added that most of these possessions
came into their power by conquest, purchase, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
imperial gift before Innocent and Hadrian ascended to
the Pontifical throne. Nicolò Fieschi alone, to pass by
others of the family, bought seventy castles in Lunigiana
from the bishop of Luni and from the lords of Carpena
then very powerful. He ceded a great part of these
feuds to the Republic, when he took the leadership of
the Guelphs and formed alliance with Naples against
the Ubertines (1270). This was the origin of long and
bitter contests which finally ended in a treaty of peace
and the absolution of Genoa from the interdict hurled
against her by Pope Gregory at the instance of Cardinal
Fieschi, whose lands the Republic had seized. The
convention provided for the cession of a great part of
the Cardinal’s feuds to Genoa (1276). We believe there
is no other family which counts in its registers two
Popes, seventy-two Cardinals and three-hundred Archbishops,
Bishops and Patriarchs. Sinibaldo who assumed
the tiara in 1242 under the title of Innocent IV, was an
illustrious Pontiff. Frederick II, who had found in
him when cardinal a warm ally, proved the strength
of his hostility when he became Pope. The Emperor
shut up the Pope in the castle of Sutri in 1244 and the
Genoese sent twenty two galleys to raise the siege and
rescue the pontiff. Innocent accompanied his deliverers
to Genoa and from here travelled by the mountain
road of Varazze to the castle of Stella, of which Jacopo
Grillo (an accomplished troubadour) was lord, and
remained there for forty days. A fountain from which
he was wont to slake his thirst is still called <i>Fontana
Del Papa</i>. From Stella he journeyed by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Acqui to Lyons, where he summoned a general council
and excommunicated Frederick, his son Corrado and
his followers and partisans the Duke of Bavaria and
Ezzelino.</p>

<p>The Emperor to avenge this affront, captured and
destroyed the castles of the Fieschi in Liguria. The
Pope, to rebuild and secure a home wasted by many invasions,
formed the magnificent scheme of surrounding
Genoa with walls and converting it into a refuge for
the Guelph party. He selected for his own residence the
convent of S. Domenico,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> which had been the church
of St. Egidius (having been donated to that patriarch
in 1220.) The Ghibellines, learning the Pope’s design,
raised a tumult and prevented the erection on that site
of the palace which afterwards adorned the summit of
Carignano.</p>

<p>Ottobuono, son of Tedisio, followed Innocent in the
papal dignity and took the name of Hadrian V. As
legate of Urban IV, he had conducted with success
some difficult political negotiations. In the Council of
Lyons and in his embassies to Germany and Spain, the
superiority of his mind had given him a foremost place.
When he ascended the pontifical throne, he curbed the
insolence of Charles of Anjou who was abusing his
office as Senator of Rome. His reign was short, for as
Dante sings,</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">
“Un mese e poco piu provò Come pesa il gran manto”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">The great Poet condemns him to the circle of the
avaricious in Purgatory, perhaps on account of the vast
wealth which he amassed while cardinal, the rental of
which exceeded a hundred thousand gold marks.</p>

<p>Luca Fieschi, Cardinal of S. Maria Invialata, was still
richer. He, like all the rest of his family, wielded the
sword as well as made pastoral addresses. The famous
Sciarra Colonna, captured by him at Anagni, had bitter
experience of his warlike spirit. This cardinal as legate
of Clement V in Italy, accompanied Henry VII in his
expedition to our Peninsula in 1311. It was through
his influence that Brescia and Piacenza were saved
from pillage as a punishment for their revolt. After
Henry’s coronation in Rome, the cardinal obtained by
a decree, issued at Pisa in 1313, the full confirmation
of all his ancient feudal rights. In his will, he ordered
that, whoever of his heirs should be patron of the
church of S. Adriano in Trigoso should build, on the
estates of Benedetta De Marini, a church of equal size
and beauty with that in Trigoso, and he bequeathed a
large amount of property to be spent in its construction.
This is the origin of that Gothic church in Vialata
whose sides are covered with alternate slabs of black
and white marbles. The word <i>Vialata</i> is not derived
from the violets which once blossomed over that height,
as some tell us, but from the cardinalate of that temple
which the vandals of our time have not yet entirely
disfigured. The friends of Luca Fieschi erected an
honourable monument to him, in the duomo of Genoa,
some remains of which are yet visible on a side door of
our cathedral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Giovanni Fieschi, bishop of Vercelli and Guelph
leader was also a military chieftain. In 1371, he
marched upon Genoa at the head of eight hundred
horse to avenge his family who as rebels had been dispossessed
of the castle of Roccatagliata by the Republic.
He waged a long war with the Visconti. They had
robbed him of Vercelli, but he reacquired this feud by
subsequent treaty. He obtained from the Pope the
temporal sovereignty of that city; and Boniface IX
and his successors invested him with Montecapelli,
Masserano and Crevacore. After his death, Vercelli
passed into the hands of his nephew Gianello, of good
fame both as a cardinal and warrior. It was by his
influence and that of Giacomo Fieschi, Archbishop of
Genoa, that the Republic undertook to rescue Urban
IX when he was besieged in Nocera di Puglia. Nor
were Guglielmo and Alberto Fieschi without military
celebrity. They conquered the kingdom of Naples for
their uncle Innocent IV. Not less warlike were Emanuele
and Giovanni Fieschi, who as bishops and lords
governed Biella in the middle of the fourteenth century.
Giovanni, however, had the misfortune to incur the
displeasure of his people, was driven from power, and
ended his days in prison, 1377. The civil life of
Genoa for many centuries was a succession of political
revolutions. The leading spirits were always the
Fieschi and Grimaldi, Guelphs, and the Spinola and
Doria, partisans of the Empire. Carlo Fieschi was
certainly a turbulent spirit and a promoter of discord.
In order to remove from power the opposite party, he
handed the Republic over to Robert of Naples, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Francesco Fieschi attempted to give Genoa to his son-in-law
the marquis of Monferrato. Francesco had
fought as Guelph general against Opizzino Spinola
and the marquis of Monferrato had given him valuable
aid in the campaign which he successfully closed by
burning Busalla and desolating the Spinola estates.</p>

<p>But Francesco exercised the rights acquired by conquest
with a moderation unusual in those times; and he
committed the government of the city to sixteen
citizens.</p>

<p>For the rest, the Fieschi though sometimes turbulent
and dangerous to the peace of the city, never laid violent
hands on the liberties of the Republic. Their
struggles aimed to emancipate the city from the influence
and control of the imperial party, and they always
faithfully served those to whom they offered their
arms.</p>

<p>It is fitting to enumerate among the heroes of this
noble line a Giacomo Fieschi whom St. Louis created
a grand marshal of France as a reward for many distinguished
services. Innocent IV. invested this Giacomo
with the kingdom of Naples and it is probable that
Charles V alluded to this fact when, writing to Sinibaldo
Fieschi, he declared him descended from the loins
of kings. Nor can we omit Giovanni Fieschi who, in
1337 governed the province of Milan and fell bravely in
battle; nor Danielo and Luca Fieschi who served as
Florentine generals. It was this Luca who in 1406
conquered Pisa.</p>

<p>The Fieschi race is not famous alone for its men; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
women have been distinguished for purity of life and
force of character, a few, unfortunately, for vicious
practices. We pass by Alassina, wife of Moruello
Malaspina whom Dante, after having lived in her court,
praised for her virtues. We know little else of her
career. We pass Virginia, daughter of Ettore Fieschi
and wife of the Prince of Piombino, a wise and virtuous
matron; and also Jacopina who after the death of her
first husband, Nino Scoto, married Obizzo da Este.</p>

<p>Alconata, or according to others Gianetta Fieschi,
daughter of Carlo and wife of Pietro de Rossi, lord
of Parma, was notorious for lascivious manners,
and a still more infamous celebrity attaches to
the name of Isabella Fieschi, wife of Lucchino
Visconti. The Milanese Chroniclers tell us that Fosca
(an epithet given to Isabella) obtained permission from
her husband to attend the naval tournament held in
Venice at the feast of the ascension in 1347. Magnificent
preparations were made in Lodi for the journey
of the duchess. She selected for her cortège the flower
of the Lombard knights and ladies. It is said that
every dame was accompanied by her admirer. Isabella
was received at Mantua with distinguished courtesy by
Ugolino Gonzaga whom she made happy by her embraces.
On her arrival in Venice she abandoned herself
to the arms of Doge Dandolo and the most elegant and
accomplished gentleman of that republican court. The
dames of her cortège, as usually happens, followed the
example and imitated the gallantries of their mistress.</p>

<p>The fame of these amours reached Milan, where after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the return of the party, the dames one after another
confessed their errors. No husband was more deeply
wounded than Lucchino, and he resolved to avenge his
dishonour in the blood of Fosca. The unscrupulous
Genoese dame, on learning the intention of her outraged
lord, frustrated it by administering to him, according
to tradition, a slow poison. Isabella was the
most beautiful woman of her time; she had a numerous
family which she confessed on her death bed to have
been the fruit of her intrigues with Galeazzo, nephew
of Lucchino, who was a brave and accomplished knight.</p>

<p>The daughter of Giacomo Fieschi and Francesca di
Negro made ample amends for the licentiousness of
these members of her family. We speak of that
Catherine whom the church has glorified as a saint.
She was beautiful in person, simple in her tastes and
pure in her life. From her earliest years she avowed
her desire to take the veil; but, constrained by her
parents, she married Giuliano Adorno, a man addicted
to every species and degree of vice. The virtues and
prayers of Catherine, whose pure spirit above all earthly
aims looked steadfastly towards heavenly things, were
powerful enough to draw him back to the paths of
virtue.</p>

<p>She was a miracle of love and wisdom. She wrote
learned works, especially a treatise upon Purgatory,
which received the encomiums of Cardinal Bellarmino,
of the doctors of the Sorbonne and of the first philosophers
and critics of that period (1510.)</p>

<p>Her relative and disciple, Tomasina Fieschi, imitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the devotional spirit of the sainted Catherine. Nor
was she less charming in person nor less gifted in
literary talents; but her manuscripts are unfortunately
lost and time has destroyed all but the sweet perfume
of her virtues.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth century, the
counts of Fieschi separated into two branches, that of
Savignone of which we do not purpose to write, and
that of Torriglia. Both however continued to call
themselves counts of Lavagna, in memory of their
origin.</p>

<p>At this early period they were followers of the imperial
party and they received from Frederic, as his
feudatories, the armorial bearing of three azure bars on a
silver field. But when Frederic quarrelled with the Holy
See the Counts embraced the Papal side and became
leaders of the Guelph party. Then they placed the cat
(gatto) over their crests in honour of the Bavarian
family, head of the Guelph faction in Germany,
which probably gave us the name. Later, they wrote
under the cat “<i>sedens ago</i>” a symbol, says Federigo, of
that wisdom which produces by force of intellect rather
than of hand.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> The Torriglia branch used sometimes
to place a dragon upon their helmets; but the cat, as
more ancient, was the true armorial bearing of the
family.</p>

<p>The Lords of Este and Monferrato, the Gonzaga,
Visconti Orsini, Sanseverini, Sanvitali, Caretto, Pallavicini<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
and Rossi took their spouses from the Fieschi
family, and received feuds, estates, and burghs as
dowries. The most illustrious families of Italy coveted
alliance with their blood. Even the counts of Savoy
intermarried with them and in this way acquired large
possessions in Piedemont. Innocent IV. married his
niece Beatrice to count Tomaso of Savoy, and gave
as dower the castles of Rivoli and Viana, together with
the valley of Sesia. In 1259 count Tomaso was
created by Innocent <i>gonfaloniere</i> of the church; and
Ottobuono Fieschi liberated from prison in Asti
Amedeo, Tomaso and Ludovico, sons of Tomaso.</p>

<p>They were not less generous and distinguished at
home. About the year 1286, they erected a large
tower and a castle at the gate of Sant’Andrea. In
times equally remote, Opizzo Fieschi built for his residence
a marble palace on the piazza of the duomo,
enriching it with statutes, decorations, and precious
vessels. This palace served afterwards for the council
chamber of the Podesta, until Boccanegra took possession
of it. Innocent IV. was born there. They built
several other palaces in the city, which enjoyed full
immunity; neither the sheriff nor his officers could
cross their thresholds to serve writs or capture those
who had taken refuge within them. The greater part
of their palaces were destroyed in the rage of civil war.
The one which Carlo Fieschi fortified near the church
of S. Donato was ruined in 1393, and a year later that
of cardinal Giacomo Fieschi, one of the most sumptuous
in Italy, shared the same fate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>They did not content themselves with adorning
Genoa with palaces. The convents of Servi, S. Leonardo,
and S. Francesco bear witness to their public
spirit, not to mention the many hospitals, churches,
and other public edifices with which they enriched the
Eastern Riviera. These public charities were at various
times rewarded with dignities and privileges, especially
by a decree that the first-born of the count of Lavagna
should sit in the council chamber above the elders and
next to the Doge. The office of doge, denied by law
to the nobles until 1528, the Fieschi, in the height of
their power, conferred upon their adherents, and in
peaceful times they were by this means masters of the
Republic. There is no instance in which a Fieschi, in
any revolution, attempted to grasp at supreme power,
or lay violent hands on popular liberty.</p>

<p>Gianluigi II. was no exception to this rule. He
purchased from Corrado Doria the feud of Loano, and
was ambitious of becoming master of Pisa. When the
Pisans asked as a favour to be incorporated into the
Republic of Genoa, Gianluigi, as a means to his private
ambition, discouraged his fellow-citizens from accepting
the gift. The Genoese were so enraged at discovering
the motives and intrigues of Fieschi, that a year after
they excluded the nobles from office, took possession of
the Fieschi castles, and elected eight tribunes of the
people as heads of the government. Louis XII., instigated
by the nobility, punished this plebeian audacity
by restoring the Fieschi to their ancient dominions,
and assigning them the government of all Eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Liguria. At that time the king visited Genoa, and
lodged in the Fieschi palace in Carignano, where, perhaps
in the festal rejoicings, he encountered that
Tomasina Spinola, who, according to the chronicles of
the period, was so smitten with his personal charms,
that she died soon after of her unhappy love.</p>

<p>The riches and power of Gianluigi gave him the title
of Great, and his virtues and varied abilities acquired
him such consideration that, when after the death of
his first wife, Bartolomea della Rovere, he wedded
Catherine, sister of the Marquis of Finale, the senate
paid homage to his distinguished merit by proclaiming
a safe conduct from Corvo to Monaco for all who should
attend the espousals. His son, Sinibaldo, did not, like
his father, cultivate the friendship of the French. His
brother was assassinated by the Fregosi, and to obtain
vengeance he used his influence to elevate the Adorni
to the place occupied by the Fregosi. When Ottaviano
Fregoso returned to power, Sinibaldo retired to his
estates, formed an alliance with the Adorni, and
marched upon Genoa in 1522. He fought bravely
against the French when Cesare Fregoso led them
against the city, but he was made prisoner, and only
obtained his liberty by the payment of a heavy ransom.
Afterwards he united with Andrea Doria to expel the
French from Genoa; he captured Savona by storm, and
gave powerful aid to Andrea in carrying the Republic
over to the Imperial cause. Having lost his brothers,
he came to be the sole head of his family, and inherited
all the vast possessions and wealth of his father.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Charles V. confirmed his titles to his estates. He went
as the ambassador of the Republic, to assume the investiture
from the emperor of some castles, and spent
on the occasion a large sum which he would not permit
the Republic to repay.</p>

<p>Sinibaldo united to his feuds Pontremoli, for which
he paid twelve thousand gold crowns<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to Francesco
Sforza. His united possessions now embraced thirty-three
walled castles, besides innumerable estates and
villas on the sides of the Appennines, bounded by
Genoa and Sarzana on the sea, and by Tortona, Bobbio,
Parma and Piacenza, inland.</p>

<p>He was also master of many other feuds separated
from his county. He drew such large revenues from
these lands that the Republic had no other citizen of
equal wealth, and he lived with a pomp and luxury till
then unknown in Italy. His munificent generosity
earned him the merited praise of Ariosto, who places
him at the fountain of Malagigi,&mdash;foremost among
those whose lances are wounding the fierce image of
avarice.</p>

<p>He died in 1532, leaving Maria della Rovere a
widow. She was the niece of Julius II., and bore Sinibaldo
a numerous family. He was buried, wrapped in
silk cloth of gold, in the vault of his fathers, in our
cathedral, and Ugo Partenopeo pronounced his funeral
oration.</p>

<p>The eldest son of Sinibaldo was that Gianluigi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
whose career we are about to describe. But in order
to pronounce a just opinion of his actual character, we
believe it important to speak at some length of the
condition of Italy and the Republic of Genoa when he
appeared on the political stage. A great man is, in
our opinion, the expression of a social want; he embodies
and expresses the ideas of the times wherein he
is born, and therefore is a compendious symbol of the
people among whom he lives.</p>

<h2 class="p4"><a name="c2" id="c2">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="pch">THE ITALIAN STATES IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.</p>

<p class="pcs">Leo X., and his false glories&mdash;Desperate condition of the Italian
states in the sixteenth century&mdash;Their aversion to the Austrian
power&mdash;The Sack of Rome&mdash;Wars and Plagues&mdash;Charles V.
and Francis I.&mdash;The Despotism of Christian powers causes
Italian powers to desire the yoke of the Turks&mdash;The Papal
theocracy renews with the empire the compact of Charlemagne.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> age of Leo X., in painting whose meretricious
splendours, our historians have rivalled each other, was
one of the most unfortunate in the history of Italy. Let
others call the age of Valentine and Charles V. the age
of gold; Raphael, Titian, and Michael Angelo cannot
make us forget Leyva, Baglioni, and the barbarians who
overran Italy, bringing in plague, famine, and intestine
war. Swiss and French in Lombardy, French and
Spaniards in Naples, Swiss and Germans in Venetia
rendered every region desolate and every government
despotic. Julius II. spoke falsehood when he boasted
that he had expelled the Ultramontanes from Italian
soil; he merely drove out one foreigner by the help of
another, and the last invaders filled the people with
desperate longing for the old oppressors. After his
death the Papal dignity was conferred on Leo de’
Medici, whose name has a false lustre in letters and
arts.</p>

<p>It was a grave delusion or a sychophantic flattery to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
attribute to him the impulse that revived liberal studies.
The great intellects who flourished under his pontificate
had risen to fame before his time. He covered them
with wealth and honours out of no sympathy with their
pursuits, but to emasculate their independent spirits
and stifle the groans of the nation in whose bosom the
spirit of independence began to react under the hammer
of incessant misfortune.</p>

<p>The manners of Leo were wholly corrupt and his
religion atheism. The Lutheran doctrines which spread
in his time owed their success to the trade in indulgences,
the profits of which he conferred before collection
upon his sister Magdalene Cybo, to repay her
family for the princely receptions they gave him in
Genoa.</p>

<p>The scribblers called him The Great, because they
lived upon him, and were only idle ornaments of a
luxurious court. He entertained the Romans with
feasts and games, because he was a devotee of pleasure,
and, according to the saying of the people, wished to
enjoy the papacy. But the chases of Corneto and
Viterbo, the infamies of Malliana, the suppers of the
gods, and the fisheries of Bolsena were paid for with
money borrowed at forty per cent. The people of the
Romagna, bleeding under his insatiable collectors of
revenue, prayed for the Turkish yoke, as a relief from
that of the Popes. When it was his plain duty to
restore his wasted provinces by permanent peace, he
excited new wars, for whose conduct he had neither
money, energy, nor talents. History has been strangely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
generous with Leo. His intrigues, his wrongheaded
policy, the fictitious conspiracy of Florence,&mdash;for which
Macchiavello was beheaded, Braccioli and Capponi
killed, and many others imprisoned or banished,&mdash;still
await a pen sharp enough to cut away his borrowed
glories.</p>

<p>At the death of Maximilian of Austria, the electors
conferred the empire on Charles V. of Spain, who was
already master of the Two Sicilies. The power of
Charles threatened the independence of Rome, and Leo
formed a league with France, in the audacious hope of
expelling the Spaniard from Italy. But he betrayed
his ally for a dukedom in the kingdom, conferred on
his bastard son Alexander de’ Medici. A war broke out,
and the Papal and Imperial troops, led by Prospero
Colonna and Marquis Pescara, had already occupied
Milan, when the sudden death of Leo cut short his enterprises.
His successor was the Flemish Van Trusen,
under the title of Hadrian VI. He had never set foot
in Italy, and was therefore called a barbarian. The
corrupt prelates despised a Pope, under whom absolution
cost only a ducat.</p>

<p>Hadrian was unable to continue the war, the Papal
treasury having been drained by the prodigality of Leo.
Besides the Rovere, Baglioni and Malatesta had seized
the Papal dominions. The other states of Italy were
not more fortunate than the Papal. Venice had been
bleeding to death since the league of Cambray; Florence
was under the heel of Julius de’ Medici; the lords
of Mantua and Ferrara were in the grasp of a master;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the Marquis of Monferrato and the Duke of Savoy were
protected by French garrisons; the kingdom of Naples
was barbarized and taxed to the verge of ruin by those
Spanish hordes who from the poverty of their clothing
were called the <i>Bisogni</i>.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Charles did not pay his
armies a sous, and they had scarcely routed the French
under Lautrec when they began a general pillage of
Italy. Though the Pope was Charles’ ally the pontificial
territory did not escape the common fate. The excesses
of Ultramontane lust and avarice bred a terrible pestilence
in Florence and in Rome; new wounds for Italy.
When the plague had reached its height, the pontiff in
an insane fright abolished the sanitary laws on the plea
that they were offensive to Heaven and heretical.
Thus the pestilence, encountering no obstacles, raged
with unchecked violence.</p>

<p>We are told that in these straits, the Romans longing
to find a barrier to such a flood of woes, sacrificed a bull
with all the pagan ceremonies to the divinities of the
ancient Republic. To such a degree had the atheism
of the popes taken root among the people!</p>

<p>Julius, of the Medici family, succeeded to Hadrian
VI.; but he did not bring peace to Italy. The French,
led by Bonnivet made a new attempt to recover Lombardy.
Prospero Colonna made them pay dearly for
the enterprise; but Francis I. invaded Italy in force,
and Milan, desolated by the plague, came into his power.
Who at that period cared for the independence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Italy? Venice, Venice alone. In the battle of Pavia,
Francis I. was beaten and captured. Venice seeing
the knife pointed at her own breast by Imperial
hands, proposed to Louisa of Savoy, mother of the
captive French king and regent of France, a general
league of the enemies of Spain, the mustering of armies
and the liberation of the illustrious prisoner. The Pope
opposed the scheme and bound himself closer to the
emperor whose satellites he paid largely for leaving
him in peace. The German leaders divided the money
and went on robbing the subjects of the Pope.</p>

<p>In the meantime the treaty of Madrid (1526) released
Francis I. from prison and he made haste to violate the
stipulations extorted from him by force. He formed
an alliance for the liberation of Italy, with the Pope,
the Venitians and Francis Sforza. The French monarch
proclaimed himself the apostle of liberty for
oppressed people and awakened everywhere the spirit
of resistance to the Spanish power. A strange delusion
that the French monarch sought to enfranchise Italy
seized upon the most illustrious men of our Peninsula.
The Genoese were especially forward in urging the Pope
to abandon the Imperial alliance and join the French
league. Foremost among those who shared this delusion
was Giammateo Ghiberti of Genoa, chancellor of
Clement VII., a knight of stainless honour and a prelate
uncontaminated by the moral leprosy which raged in
the Roman court.</p>

<p>The choicest spirit in literature and science supported
the generous hopes of Ghiberti. Among them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Pietro Bembo who had been secretary to Leo X., Ludovico
Canossa, the French ambassador in Venice, and
Jacopo Sodoleto, an extraordinary genius whom the
amorous overtures of the beautiful Imperia failed to
degrade. Sodoleto, a man deeply religious and patriotic
had urged Clement to make bold reforms in the bosom
of the church. He founded in Rome, with the cöperation
of Ghiberti, Bembo, Caraffa and many others, the
oratorio of divine love, and he openly professed his belief
in the doctrine of justification by faith, a dogma of the
evangelical churches.</p>

<p>Around these leaders, the lovers of liberal studies and
of their country, began to form a party, which included
such men as Valeriano Pierio, Vida, Bini, Blasio, Negri,
Navagero and even Berni, who, when he saw that Pope
Clement neglected the advice of patriots and clung to
Spain, prophesied that the Pope and his shearers would
share the ruin of Italy. This awaking to liberty and
the increasing aversion of the Italians to the Imperial
power, stimulated the Spanish governors to harsher
measures. The desertion of their party by the duke of
Milan furnished the conquerors with a specious pretext
for desolating whole provinces and draining the blood
of the people by taxation and subsidies. This unfortunate
country saw at that moment a spectacle of unbridled
barbarity without parallel in history. The
Spanish soldiers were quartered in the houses of the
Milanese, and the citizen was treated not as a host but
as a prisoner. His feet were tied to a bed, or to a
beam; or he was thrown into a cellar, where he would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
be tormented into surrendering money or lands; or to
the gratification of a more vile cupidity. When the
unfortunate victim died of grief or, impelled by rage
and despair, drowned himself in a well or threw himself
from a window, the <i>Bisogni</i> immediately sought
another house in which to renew the same barbarities.
The Lombard provinces had not even the consolation
of human pity. The duke of Urbino, commanding the
armies of Venice and Rome, gave them no encouragement
to hope. Indeed, he lacked the means for open
war or even for skirmishing with the Spanish army.
Germany poured down new soldiers. Shall we say
soldiers? George Frandesperg marched at the head of
fifteen thousand robbers, and swore to put a halter
round the neck of the Pope and to pay his legions with
the pillage of Italian cities.</p>

<p>Nor were foreigners the only tormentors of the
bleeding peninsula. In Rome the Orsini supported the
Pope the Colonna were partisans of Cæsar. Cardinal
Pompeo collected eight thousand peasants on the <i>Agro
Romano</i> and unleashed them against the Vatican.
They made a general pillage and their leader compelled
the <i>Sultan of Christianity</i>, as he styled the Pope, to
break the league he had formed with Venice and
France. Deeds were committed which history shrinks
from recording. The Ultramontanes, not content with
enslaving provinces, slaked their thirst in the blood of
the people. The inhumanity of the Germans, the
avarice of the Swiss&mdash;who even then made merchandise
of their fealty&mdash;the rapacity of the Aragonese and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
licentiousness of the Gauls reached and polluted everything
in Italy.</p>

<p>It is true that there was this diversity in their
manners, that the Swiss and Germans, despising the
restraints of both law and religion, utterly despoiled
the vanquished and revelled in every species of brutality;
while the French divided the spoils with those
to whom they belonged and seduced, instead of violating,
the women. As for the Spaniards, words are inadequate
to describe the cruelty with which they
slaughtered and tore in pieces our conquered populations.
Macchiavello has finely contrasted the French
and the Spaniards of that time. “The Frenchman is
equally prodigal of his own property and that of his
neighbour and he robs with small concern whether he
is to eat the booty, destroy it or make riot of it with
the lawful owner. The spirit of the Spanish plunderer
is different; when he robs you do not hope to see a shred
of your own again.” Spanish despotism imprinted its
bloody hands on the face of every province. Witness
the pillage of Rome by the Constable of Bourbon&mdash;who
perished there, perhaps by the hand of Cellini&mdash;for
proof that the Goth Alaric and every other barbarian
leader were less ferocious than a christian army. The
Spanish hordes plundered all the wealth and precious
vessels which the devotion of christendom had amassed
in the churches of Rome during twelve centuries. The
Spanish catholics were worse vandals than the German
Lutherans. Whoever escaped the clutches of the one
was put to death by the other, or at best only saved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
himself by paying heavy ransom. In Rome the most
venerable things were put to unseemly uses. Drunken
soldiers in sacred robes and mitres danced obscene
dances in the streets and public squares, and their
impious mockeries always ended in bloody saturnalia.
The corpses of murdered citizens strewed the streets;
and after nine months of this carnival of death, a fierce
pestilence broke out to complete the desolation.</p>

<p>The emperor derived no advantage from imprisoning
the Pope, wasting his provinces and butchering his
people. A pressing want of money induced Charles to
restore Julius to his throne, as the same motive had led
him to liberate the French king. It seems incredible
that the master of Spain, the Netherlands, Sicily, the
Lombard provinces and Mexico should have drawn no
profit from his vast possessions. The Lutheran movement
in Germany, the threats of France, the distrust
of the king of England, the secret intrigues of the Pope
and the doubtful fidelity of some Italian princes,
whom Venice was inciting to revolt, may have conspired
to palsy his arms in the very moment of victory.</p>

<p>A little before the sack of Rome, Odo di Foix, lord
of Lautrec and general of France avenged the defeat of
his sovereign at Pavia by capturing this city and subjecting
it to an eight day’s pillage. The edifices were
so ruined and the population so thinned that Leandro
Alberti writes;&mdash;“The sight of it excited compassion.”
It is melancholy satisfaction to write, that, of the crowds
of foreigners who poured into Italy to plunder and
ravage, very few returned to their native lands. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Peninsula became their sepulchre&mdash;of the French particularly&mdash;who
to speak truth, seldom committed those
excesses which were common to the Spaniards and
Germans. It may be added, too, that it has always
been the misfortune of France to make useless conquests
in Italy. Her army which, after the destruction of
Melfi, advanced to the siege of Naples, counting more
than twenty-five thousand men, was so thinned by
pestilential fevers that two months afterwards it did
not contain four thousand men fit for duty. The
frightful plague did not spare Lautrec, and after the
treaty of Antwerp only a few skeletons were permitted
to set foot on the soil of France. The army which
deluged Rome with blood met with a more calamitous
fate. Shut up in Naples under the Prince of Orange,
governor of that city, it was attacked and mowed down
by a pestilence which was at once the consequence and
punishment of its insane license. Even Francis Bourbon,
count of San Polo, who, the <i>Bisogni</i> having left
nothing to plunder, put the villages and hamlets through
which he passed to fire and sword, was totally defeated
and made prisoner in Landriano (1529) by the ferocious
Antonio di Leyva, the scourge of Lombardy.</p>

<p>The kings becoming weary, the people being drained
of their blood, the necessity of peace was strongly felt.
Charles V., who had no title to greatness, but the extent
of his dominions, who was crooked in design and
avaricious of spirit, hastened to form an incestuous
union with the Pope, and the fruit of their embraces
was the slavery of Florence. Cæsar bound himself to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
immolate the Republic to the vengeance of Clement
and put under Papal pay the hordes of assassins who
had already desolated the greater part of the Peninsula.
The bastard Alexander de’ Medici married a bastard
daughter of the emperor; whence the treaty of Cambray
by which France delivered Italy, bound hand and
foot to Charles Fifth, recovering Bourgogne and his
children for the shameful desertion. He ignominiously
lost in this treaty the honour which he preserved
stainless in his defeat and capture at Pavia. This king
had strange contradictions in his character. He promised,
with apparent sincerity, liberty to nations and
then abandoned them at caprice; he was hated by
people whom he overwhelmed with public burdens,
but loved by the learned whom he protected and
honoured. He offered his hand to the heretics of
Germany, and burned under a slow fire the heretics of
France. He invited the Turks into Italy and betrayed
the Venitians and Florentines; but he kept faith with
his bitter enemy, granting Charles V. safe conduct
through French territory.</p>

<p>The pontiff being about to crown Charles in Bologna
with the Lombard and Imperial diadems, the latter
ordered the Italian princes, as his vassals, to pay him
homage on that occasion (1530). Alfonso d’Este,
Frederick Gonzaga, the dukes of Urbino and Savoy,
and the Marquis of Monferrato submitted to him; the
Republics of Genoa, Siena and Lucca counted themselves
happy in being permitted to retain their old
form of government, and Florence which under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
influence of Nicolò Capponi had elected Christ for its
king, now vainly defended by the brave Ferruccio was
forced to humble herself to slavery. That portion of
North Italy which in modern language is called Piedmont
was involved in equal if not greater disasters.
On account of its situation between Austria and France,
it was overrun and desolated by barbarian invaders
from 1494 to 1559. “We do not believe,” say the
commissioners of Henry VIII. of England, “that it is
possible to find in all Christendom greater wretchedness
than reigns in this country. The best towns are either
in ruins or depopulated. There are few districts in
which food is to be found. The extensive plain, fifty
miles in length, which lies between Vercelli and Pavia,
once so fertile in cereals and wines, is reduced to a
desert. The fields are uncultivated; except three poor
women gathering a few grapes, we saw not the shadow
of a human creature. There, they neither sow nor
reap; the country sides are growing wild, and the uncultivated
vines are returning to their primitive state.”</p>

<p>Charles III., the unfortunate, was ruling over these
desolated provinces and his subjects suffered every
species of indignity, outrage and despotism. To render
matters, if possible, a little worse, Gonzaga urged the
Emperor to reduce to a swamp all that wide plain
between the Alps and the Po to form a barrier to
French invasion of Lombardy.</p>

<p>In fine, there was no city in all Italy which was not
conquered and oppressed by foreign armies. Of Genoa
I shall speak in its place. It is worth while to mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Nice, where in 1538 Paul III. held the congress at which
a truce was concluded between Cæsar and Francis I.
Five years afterwards, Francis marched upon and
besieged it with the help of the Turks. This siege is
memorable in Italian history for the heroic spirit of
Segurana, but after the death at the sword’s point of
all her bravest defenders, the city was forced to surrender.
The citizens abandoned their homes, though
they had obtained a promise of immunity for their
property from pillage by the soldiery. The Turks kept
faith, while the French violated their pledges, thus
giving rise to a general desire among Italians to become
subject to the Turks, from a conviction that they could
no longer endure the weight of their misfortunes.
There were writers as Vives, who speaking of Italy,
(1529) sought to discourage this sentiment, telling the
Italians that the Turks would heap worse miseries
upon them. But it is incredible that Soliman could
have equalled the endless tortures inflicted by Francis
I. and Charles V. Segni says: “More than two
hundred thousand persons killed in war, more than a
hundred cities and important castles sacked and
destroyed, so many thousands of innocent men and
women destroyed by pestilence and famine that one
cannot number them, matrons debauched, maidens
ravished, abominable practices with children, an endless
catalogue of crimes against religion and nature committed
against each other by christians, all owe their
origin to the implacable enmity of two men, who were
born and have grown old in eternal hatred to each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
other. They are not weary of shedding the blood of
their fellows; they continue to fight and will fight to
the end of their lives.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He proceeds:&mdash;“Afflicted
peoples cannot do better than pray God to destroy or
subject them both to the sway of the grand Turk, so
that the world may come under the power of a single
monarch, who, though he be a barbarian and an enemy
to our laws, may give us a little repose wherein to rear
our children to a life, of poverty indeed, but free from
the burdens of our miserable existence.”</p>

<p>The people of Germany, always restless under the
yoke of ancient Rome, were rising against the Papal
power, which had taken the place of the ancient empire.
At the voice of Luther laying bare the festering
diseases of the Roman court, the learned of Italy were
moved. The Pope comprehended that there was no
other means of extirpating the seeds of reform which
had already sprung up in Italy but to ally himself with
catholic Spain: she was in the zenith of her glory.
Such captains as Cortes and Pizzaro sailed away with
a galley and returned conquerors of a new world. Who
better than the compatriots of Torquemada could
suffocate in blood the free voices of the disciples of
Huss and Wicliffe? From that moment the compact of
Charlemagne was renewed between Charles V. and
the Roman theocracy, and through it the Spaniards
tightened their grasp on Milan, Naples, Palermo and
Cagliari, and established their ascendency over the
whole Peninsula.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>From Charles V. dates our humiliation and slavery.
From his time the Peninsula has had no proper history.
Its vicissitudes and calamities are only episodes of the
great drama enacted by the nations who have fought
against each other for our blood. The council of Trent
was not an act of national life. It grew out of the
philosophic spirit of reform and the scandals of the
Roman court, and was initiated by Germany and
France while England was separating herself from the
catholic church. This celebrated synod shows nothing
but the conflict between the church and the empire,
between the reformers and the courtiers of Rome
struggling to maintain their privileges, between the
Popes who fought to maintain their abuses and the
secular princes who secretly laboured to shake off the
priestly yoke. The Italian people had no part in it.
The religious discussions upon divine grace, predestination
and justification by faith did not reach us, who
were everywhere plotting to recover our independence
and freedom.</p>

<p>In fact this is the century of popular conspiracies,
which were always strangled by degenerate nobles and
foreign armies. It is true that the most illustrious
Italians sided with the people and died for their
righteous cause; but these were vain struggles. From
the day that Lorenzino de’Medici, for whom the
Spanish power (which Duke Alexander was consolidating
in Italy) was too bitter, formed the design of
restoring the Republic and then, bought by promises of
lascivious embraces, stifled his own purpose, the spark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of liberty took fire and in every city the plebeians rose
against their foreign oppressors.</p>

<p>Such, briefly, was the condition of Italy in the early
part of the sixteenth century, in which she lost that
preëminence and reputation under which she had
hitherto flourished. It is necessary to study this
period, because it was then that Europe initiated the
great work of her civil renovation, while in Italy there
was desperate strife between dying liberties and rising
tyrannies. Two hostile forces were wrestling together
and shaking men’s souls; the regal and foreign dominion
supported by the nobles, and the generous pride
of citizens making heroic sacrifices to remain a people.
Charles V. turned the trembling balance. Only in that
age could have risen the company of Jesus, who did
not, like the monks, constitute a democracy but an
absolute monarchy such as Cæsar was founding on the
ruins of our communes. The disciples of Loyola and
the nobles were the sole supporters of the Austro-Spanish
power, and they showed a common solicitude
to strengthen the principles of despotic government.</p>

<p class="pch">ANDREA DORIA AND THE REPUBLIC OF GENOA.</p>

<p class="pcs">The Nobles and the People&mdash;Andrea Doria and his first enterprises&mdash;How
he abandoned France, and went over to the Emperor&mdash;Accusations
and opinions with regard to his motives&mdash;The laws
of the <i>Union</i> destroyed the popular, and created the aristocratic
Government&mdash;The objects of Doria in contrast with those of the
Genoese Government and the Italian Republics&mdash;The lieutenants
of Andrea and his naval forces&mdash;Popular movements arrested
by bloody vengeance.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">We</span> turn with painful recollections from the conditions
of Italy to that of the Genoese Republic. Our annals
offer us only vicissitudes of intestine divisions and
wars, in which, however, there were heroic achievements
that have rendered the Republic illustrious.</p>

<p>The history of Liguria is full of the Doria name.
There is no modern family which can boast so many
examples of heroism as this house, and only the Scipios
among the ancients are entitled to equal fame. From
the earliest times they were partisans of the empire;
while the Fieschi, after Innocent IV. maintained the
cause of the people, drawing to that side the powerful
family of Grimaldi. The Doria and Spinola formed
alliance, and became the leaders of the Ghibellines.
From that moment a warm contest arose between these
great families, and it did not end until, in 1257, the
people elected Guglielmo Boccanegra captain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
defender of their liberties. After his death, the hostile
nobles renewed their insane discords; but the people,
weary of these domestic wars and following the examples
of other Italian communes, drove out the nobles,
(1340) and created Simon Boccanegra first Doge. The
nobles were by law excluded from this highest office,
and even from the command of a galley;<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and not a
few illustrious families passed into the ranks of the
people by their own election. It is well known that
before the reforms of Doria, the so-called nobles were
held in less honour than distinguished men of the
people, because their rank excluded them from the
Dogate and many other offices. The Doria and Spinola
came to power in a revolutionary period, and in violation
of law. This severe prohibition was afterwards
modified, but the office of Doge continued to be a
popular prerogative. The principal families of the
people were the Adorni and Fregosi, in whose hands
the supreme offices remained for several centuries, and
these names are conspicuous in our civil conflicts which
were so frequent and bitter that in one year the head
of the government was four times changed. In these
calamitous times&mdash;redeemed from disgrace by the three
manly figures of Columbus, Julius II., and Andrea
Doria,&mdash;the Genoese, whose misfortune has ever been
to despise servitude and to be incapable of preserving
liberty, were compelled to invoke the protection of
princes strong enough to curb the ambition of individual
citizens. But it was always stipulated that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
franchises of the city should not be impaired, nor its
laws changed; there was, in fact, no true transfer of
power. Whenever we were borne down by foreign
arms, it was the work of the nobility conspiring against
the people.</p>

<p>Even in the time of Louis XII., when Italy was
yielding him a tardy and reluctant obedience, the
Genoese rose in rebellion, triumphed over the plots of
the nobles, threw down the government of the royal
vicar, drove out the army of Cleves, assembled in the
Church of St. Maria di Castello, and elected eight
tribunes of the people. The nobles were put to flight,
the hostile army routed, and supreme power returned
to the hands of the people.</p>

<p>The Geonese showed themselves truly great. They
drew out of his workshop Paolo da Novi, a silk dyer,
and despite his modest refusals elected him Doge. Nor
did they err in electing the modest operative to the
highest office. “Paolo,” as Foglietta writes, “was a man
of honour and integrity, pure from every vice, and
proof against all the temptations of the great.” His
first and sole study was the glory and unity of the
Republic. He, in fact, reconquered some feuds for the
state, particularly Monaco, which the Grimaldi had
usurped.</p>

<p>In the midst of Paolo’s generous designs, Louis XII.,
to whom the Geonese nobility had opened the doors of
their country, descended upon him with a formidable
army. Genoa was converted into a field of battle;
every plebeian became a soldier, and the valour of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
citizens checked the impetuous advance of the French
battalions. But the patriots were overcome by numbers
and discipline; Paolo di Novi was betrayed and
butchered; the people were reduced to slavery. Rodolfo
di Lanoia, to whom Louis committed the government
of the city, was constrained to resign his office,&mdash;says
Foglietta&mdash;on account of the boundless avarice and
insolence of the nobles who struggled to advance their
private interests by ruining the public weal.</p>

<p>As Boccanegra was the father of our popular liberty
so Doria was its executioner. He wrested the government
from the hands of the people, and committed it
to those of the nobles. He momentarily silenced, but
did not destroy, the rage of parties. By depressing
the populace, he cut the nerves of the Republic; he
gave us independence in name, but he destroyed the
franchises of the citizens. A great historian has justly
said, that the liberties given us by Andrea Doria are
ridiculous; the future will accept that as the final
decision of history.</p>

<p>Andrea was a soldier from his youth. He learned
the rudiments of war from Domenico Doria, who was
of his blood and had distinguished himself in the court
of Innocent VIII. He served successfully under the
Pope, Ferdinando the old of Naples and his son Alfonso
II., and sustained the siege of Rocca Guglelma
against Gonsalvo di Cordova. Afterwards he fought
under Giovanni della Rovere, duke of Urbino, and
having been elected tutor of the duke’s son, Francesco
Maria, he saved him from the intrigues of Cæsar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Borgia, by taking him to Venice and entrusting him to
the protection of the Venitian senate.</p>

<p>He allied himself with the party of the Fregosi, who
were friends of his house; and when Doge Ottaviano
besieged for twenty-two months the fortress of Cape
Faro, which was held for the French; he fought single-handed
with the brave Emanuel Cavallo, and was
slightly wounded in the contest.</p>

<p>But his greatest glory was acquired in naval war.
His battles with the Moors and Turks gave him fame
and wealth, and after the battle of Pianosa (1519), in
which, with six vessels, he conquered thirteen of the
enemy’s; capturing several with the famous corsair
Gad Ali’ he became the terror of Saracen ships. When
the Fregosi were driven from power and their places
taken by the Adorni, Doria, disdaining to serve under
this family, sold his services to France, and took with
him six galleys belonging to the Republic, which he
never restored. The motive of this appropriation of
public property was his bitter animosity to Spain,
whose party the Adorni and the Republic had embraced.
This animosity was rendered more violent by
the sack of Genoa in 1522 by the Spanish army, a
pillage so horrible that when the authors of it, Pescara,
Colonna and Sforza, presented themselves to Pope
Hadrian humbly asking pardon, the pontiff indignantly
repulsed them, crying,&mdash;“I cannot, I ought not, I will
not forgive you.”</p>

<p>Doria was so incensed that he condemned to chains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
and the galleys, without hope of redemption, all
Spaniards who fell into his hands.</p>

<p>In the year 1527, Pope Clement VIII. was allied
with his most Christian Majesty, with the Venitians
the Florentines and other governments against the
power of Charles. To further the objects of the alliance
Francis sent Lautrec into Italy at the head of forty
thousand men, and Andrea Doria besieged Genoa with
a large force. It is not within our scope to describe
how the Republic, through the influence of Cæsar
Fregosi and Doria, went over to the party of France.
Francis, to gratify the wishes of Andrea, entrusted the
government to Teodoro Trivulzio, Antoniotto Adorno,
having gracefully retired from the office of Doge.</p>

<p>Doria having been created admiral of France, with a
salary of thirty-six thousand crowns, rose to great fame,
on account of his victories and those of his lieutenants.
Among these victories, that of Filippino Doria in the
gulf of Salerno, deserves a brief mention, both because
it was won by Italian arms, and because something
should be added to the accounts given by other authors.
Lautrec, while besieging Naples, desired to blockade
the port, so as to prevent the supply of provisions to
its defenders, and sent for the galleys of Doria, seven
of which were then in Leghorn, under the command of
Filippino Doria Count of Sassocorbario and Canosa
and Andrea’s cousin.</p>

<p>Naples, surrounded on every side, would have been
unable to sustain the siege, and the viceroy, Hugo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Moncada, saw the necessity of breaking the enclosing
lines by some daring undertaking. He collected six
galleys called the <i>Capitana</i> and <i>Gobba</i>, (the property
of Fabrizio Giustiniano) one belonging to Sicames,
another which was the property of Don Bernardo
Vallamarino, the <i>Perpugnana</i> and <i>Calabrese</i>. To
these were added ten brigantines and some smaller
vessels. The viceroy embarked upon the ships twelve
hundred Spaniards clad in mail and commanded by the
flower of the officers and barons of the kingdom.
Finally, he himself joined the expedition and gave the
command of the artillery to Gerolamo da Trani and
that of the army to Fabrizio Giustiniano, called the
hunchback, a brave Genoese in the pay of Spain. The
latter, knowing the courage and skill of the Ligurian
mariners advised that the Spanish fleet should avoid a
close engagement with Doria; but a contrary opinion
prevailed.</p>

<p>Count Filippino was in the waters of Salerno when
the report reached him that the imperial fleet had left
Naples.</p>

<p>He asked Lautrec to reinforce him with only two
hundred infantry. Of the eight vessels under his command,
that is, the <i>Capitana</i>, <i>Pellegrina</i>, <i>Donzella</i>,
<i>Sirena</i>, <i>Fortuna</i>, <i>Mora</i>, <i>Padrona</i> and <i>Signora</i>, he sent
the three last under the command of Nicolò Lomellino
out to sea as if they wished to escape, with orders,
however, to turn about, and, driving down before the
wind, attack the enemy in the rear. Filippino with
the remaining five vessels awaited the assault of Moncada,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
who, trusting to the strength of his fleet and the
bravery of his captains, confidently looked for a signal
victory. The galley of the viceroy closed with the
Capitana, the flag-ship of Doria, who, firing his basilisk,
small cannon and falconets, raked the Spanish vessel
from prow to poop with such fatal accuracy that forty
armed men were killed, among whom were the bravest
barons of the kingdom, Leo Tassino, a nobleman of
Ferrara, Luigi Cosmano a famous musician, Don Pietro
di Cardona and many others. The batteries of Moncada
replied but did little damage to the Genoese. The
<i>Gobba</i>, the galley of Sicames and that of Don Bernardo
were more fortunate. They closed with the <i>Pellegrina</i>
and the <i>Donzella</i> and the Spanish soldiers boarded
without difficulty. The <i>Perpugnana</i> and the <i>Calabrese</i>
cannonaded the <i>Sirena</i> until she was forced to
surrender. Doria had now lost three galleys, the
<i>Capitana</i> and the <i>Fortuna</i> were in imminent danger
of being boarded, not being able to sustain the attacks
of six galleys and fifteen smaller vessels whose grappling
irons were seizing them on every side. Everything
looked propitious for Moncada and victory seemed
secure to him, when the three galleys which Doria
had sent to sea turned their prows and bore down
swiftly before the wind. At close quarters, they poured
in a terrible fire which dismasted the Spanish vessels
and strewed their decks with the dead. The viceroy
himself while standing upon the quarter deck of his
vessel with his sword in one hand, and <i>rotella</i> in the
other, animating his crews, was wounded in his right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
arm by an arquebus, his left thigh was broken by a
falconet and he fell among his men mowed down under
the fire-balls and showers of stones poured in by the
Genoese. Having captured the flag-ship of the viceroy,
Lomellino assailed the <i>Gobba</i>. Here more than a
hundred arquebusiers were killed, Cæsar Fieramosca
lost his life and Giustiniano was wounded and lost his
galley. Filippino Doria now released from their chains
the convicts and the Turkish slaves with a promise of
liberty and sent them to recover the <i>Donzella</i>, which
they soon accomplished. They attacked the <i>Pellegrina</i>
and the <i>Sirena</i> with such fury that the <i>Perpugnana</i> and
<i>Calabrese</i>, seeing further defence useless, turned their
prows and sailed away seaward. The brigantines were
reduced to helpless wrecks and the remainder of the
Spanish vessels found it impossible to continue the
conflict. The marquis of Vasto and Ascanio Fieramosca,
after having displayed a most admirable
courage, seeing their galleys reduced to a sinking
condition, Gerolamo da Trani killed, their captains
wounded, their soldiers shattered and pounded by stones
and half consumed by fire, gracefully surrendered to
Nicolò Lomellino who was already at close quarters
with the <i>Mora</i>. Sicames and Don Bernardo Vallamarino,
fighting to the last, were killed and their ships
sunk. All the lancers were killed, but their leader
Corradino escaped with the galley <i>Perpugnana</i>.
The killed amounted to more than a thousand and
the prisoners were much more numerous. Among the
latter, the ancient chronicles enumerate the marquis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Vasto, Ascanio Fieramosca, the Prince of Salerno, the
marquis Santa Croce, Fabrizio Giustiniano, and other
illustrious barons and famous warriors.</p>

<p>This action was fought on the 28th of April, 1528.
It was not long after this signal victory so fatal to the
imperial power and counted so honourable to the name
of Doria&mdash;though it was fought by his lieutenant
Filippino&mdash;that Andrea changed sides and enlisted under
the very power he had conquered.</p>

<p>History has not yet given a satisfactory account of
the motives which led Doria, hitherto a violent enemy
of Cæsar, to desert the standard of France and offer his
sword to Spain. It was a desertion fruitful of numberless
misfortunes as we shall show in the progress of
this work. It is certain that this change contributed
more largely than anything else to alter the fortunes
of Italy, and to reduce her to slavery under the empire.
It induced both peoples and princes to submit to the
Spanish power, Luigi Alamanni, seduced by the influence
of Andrea, adopted that policy, though he was
one of the warmest friends of liberty, and he attempted
to persuade the Florentines to ally themselves with
Cæsar. The unfortunate patriot suffered for his
delusion. The people hearing the rumour that he
advocated such opinions compelled him to seek personal
safety in exile from Florence.</p>

<p>Returning to the question, we mention first the
reasons put forward by the historians for the justification
of Doria. They tell us that France had not paid
him according to her promises; that Frances I. took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
away from him the prince of Orange whom Doria had
captured, thus defrauding the Admiral of the twenty
thousand ducats of ransom; that the king sought to
get possession of the marquises Vasto and Colonna
with a like motive; that this monarch granted favours
in prejudice of Genoese rights to rebellious Savona;
and that a rumour ran of the king’s having given this
city in feud to Montmorency.</p>

<p>However, Doria was blamed (according to the testimony
of Varchi,) by the greater part of the Italians,
and many accused him of desertion and treason. They
said that his conduct was not dictated by his resentment
at the liberty of Savona, or the slavery of Genoa,
which he himself enslaved, but rather by his boundless
appetite for wealth and honours. Some affirm that
Giovanni Battista Lasagna, whom Doria had sent to
Paris to treat for the recovery of Savona, informed him
that the king’s council had determined to deprive him,
not only of his prisoners, but also of his own life, and
that this information led him to enlist under Cæsar.
Others, on the contrary, say that the king of France
having heard that Doria intended to abandon his service,
sent to him Pierfrancesco di Noceto, Count of
Pontremoli and his esquire, to dissuade him from that
design and to promise payment of the ransom of
Orange and other prisoners as well as the Admiral’s
personal salary. It is difficult to arrive at the truth
when testimony is so conflicting. One fact only is
unquestioned: that before the last day of the month of
June, the period at which his contract with France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
would expire, he mounted his galley and repaired to
Lerici.</p>

<p>At Lerici, Filippino, having abandoned the blockade
of Naples, joined him, and by the good offices of the
marquis Vasto he opened negociations with Cæsar and
entered into the service of Spain, sending back to
Francis the decorations of the order of St. Michael
with which that monarch had honoured him. This
desertion to the imperial party gave to Charles V. (as
Segni has sensibly said) the victory in the Italian strife.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>While these events were passing, there were secret
and public consultations in Genoa, for the purpose of
quieting the political factions, uniting the citizens and
organizing the civil government on a better basis. The
chief honours of this undertaking belong to Ottaviano
Fregoso, who in 1520 was engaged in these efforts,
acting with Raphael Ponzoni. For the time these praiseworthy
designs were unsuccessful, because Federico
Fregoso, archbishop of Salerno and brother of the Doge,
opposed the project with all his ingenuity and power,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
going so far as to drive out from the Cathedral of San
Lorenzo those citizens who had assembled to promote
concord. The difficult task was resumed in 1528, and,
amidst the horrors of a pestilence which was mowing
down the population, a union was effected without the
coöperation of Doria, though it is now clearly proved
that even France counselled the measure. On the 12th
of December, Doria, contrary to the general wish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the citizens, including his own relations who were open
partisans of France, presented himself before Genoa,
landed his mariners and without bloodshed liberated
the city from the control of the small French garrison.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It is painful to see this brave Admiral selling his
sword now to the Pope, now to Naples, now to France,
and finally to Spain! It is painful to see him becoming
the ally of foreign oppressors who sought to
subdue our peoples and engulf Italy. History must
pronounce him more fortunate than great. In truth,
most of his undertakings were singularly successful;
but his attempts to capture the famous corsair Chisr,
better known under the name of Barbarossa, who was
governing Algiers for Selim with the title of <i>Begherbeg</i>,
were not crowned with success. Indeed, a rumour ran
that between these two lords of the main there was a
secret contract that they should never meet in pitched
battles. It is certain that Doria conducted his war
upon his rival with much coldness and rather as a
neutral than as an enemy. He permitted the pirate to
escape at Prevesa (1539), when he had the power to
destroy his fleet.</p>

<p>This failure of Doria left the fierce corsair to spread
the terror of his name for many years along the Italian
coasts, particularly in the kingdom of Naples, where
he had already carried desolation and ruin, devoting to
fire and pillage Noceto, Sperlunga and Fondi. He had
been attracted thither by the beauty of Giulia Gonzaga,
who narrowly escaped his hands by fleeing in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
night dress, accompanied only by a single page. The
poor page suffered most, for she caused him to be
stabbed because he had that night either seen or dared
too much.</p>

<p>Doria is also accused of having used every means to
excite the Turks against Venice; and this Republic,
through his plotting, was assailed in her Greek possessions.
Doria, by refusing to unite his forces to those
of the Pope and the Venitians, incurred the responsibility
for the capture of seven thousand Christians at
the siege of Corfu, the pillage of the Ionian Islands
and of Dalmatia. Having become a blind devotee of
Spain, whose rule in the Peninsula he wished to
strengthen, he refused to fight at Prevesa, because the
Venitians had declined to receive his <i>Bisogni</i> on board
their galleys; or, which amounts to the same thing, in
order to let a flood of Turks overwhelm Venice and
render her submissive to the yoke of Spain. All parties
accused him of having promoted the ruin of Christians
by the very means to which they looked for salvation.</p>

<p>As to the history of his policy in Genoa, if it were
our office to write the life of Andrea, there is much
that deserves to be rendered more clear. It was not
a sagacious policy to subject the Republic to Spain at
a time when the seeds of civil concord were springing
up. It was more foolish to permit a foreign ruler to
carry on her government, and despite the entreaties of
his relatives to permit Savona to be torn from the body
of the Republic.</p>

<p>Nor should it be forgotten that soon after this, he, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
promote his own ends, wished to make Genoa a partner
in his alienation from France, though his family
favoured the <i>union</i> promoted by the amiable Trivulzio
and the King of France. Truth requires us, also, to
assert that he did not enter the service of Spain with
the praiseworthy object of recovering Savona for Genoa.
He drove out the French from Genoa in September,
1528, but Savona had been from the first of July reconciled
and restored to the Republic, a fact which is
proved by a decree of Francis I. soon to be printed.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
When Guicciardini wrote that, “among the motives
attributed to Doria for his change of masters, it was
believed that the most probable and the principal one
was, not offended pride for having been too highly
esteemed or any other personal discontent, but the
desire to advance his own greatness under the name of
national liberty,” we think the verdict creditable to the
first of our Italian historians.</p>

<p>But these accusations cannot deprive Doria of the
merit of having refrained from assuming the absolute
sovereignty of his country; though we know that the
love of liberty in his fellow citizens must have been,
sooner or later, fatal to such an ambition. In such an
open assault upon popular liberty, he would have found
enemies in his own house, as he did, in fact, when he
enlisted in the service of Spain. This is proved by the
documents which Molini<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> found in the French Archives,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
and is a conspicuous proof of the profound antipathy
of Liguria to Spain. Doria, knowing well the liberal
tendencies of his fellow citizens, contrived to get
princely authority and power without assuming the
name.</p>

<p>The laws of the <i>union</i> shaped by him changed the
face of the Republic. His chief reform consisted in
removing the middle classes from the public offices by
adding new families to the nobility. The gentlemen
resented the elevation of plebeians to their side; the
lower classes complained; for though the law left them
free to ascribe themselves to the nobility, it was soon
seen that this law was a new deception. The constitution
of Doria was fashioned with aristocratic aims, and
if it established equality, it was only among the nobles.
The people had neither guaranty nor representation.
Leo writes that however wisely the instrument was
framed, it failed to establish the rights of the plebeians.
This class had no more share in the state than the
peasantry of the Riviera, and remained, with its precarious
and humble title of citizenship, subject to the
nobility.</p>

<p>The law which changed a family into a collection of
persons, or <i>Albergo</i>, was more than unjust, it was
iniquitous. Those who entered these <i>Alberghi</i> were
forced to renounce their own names, however honourable
they might be, to extinguish their own memory
and that of their ancestors, in order to assume the name
of the congregation; so that for example, a Biagio
Asereto would be compelled to take the name of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Vivaldi for no other reason than that the latter name
was borne by more persons. Many truly illustrious
and most honourable houses preferred to remain in the
number of the people; and it is related that of two
brothers Castelli; one made himself a noble under the
title of Grimaldi, while the other remained a man of the
people under his christian name Giustiniano.</p>

<p>It can no longer be denied that the laws of 1528
destroyed the government by the people and created
that by the nobility. The book of gold was opened
every year to eight plebeians of the city and of the
Riviera; but this was not enough to silence the just
complaints of that portion of the people, who until
these reforms had always taken part in public affairs.
In 1531, to satisfy the common grievance, forty-seven
families, who before had been left forgotten among the
lower class, were enrolled among the nobles; the expedient
did not at all tend to remove the defects of the
constitution. These admissions into the class who held
power were controlled by the caprices of a single person
or at best only a few. Every year eight senators were
appointed to select the eight families for promotion,
and in practice each senator selected one from his
friends among the people. The gravest abuses grew
out of this, and the book of gold was often opened to
the most vulgar and degraded plebeians.</p>

<p>Neither moral nor intellectual qualifications, nor
even distinguished services rendered to the country,
could break down the barrier to the patriciate; but
the inscribing of a name often served for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
dowers of Senator’s daughters&mdash;nay, it was even
sold.</p>

<p>The new nobles, in order to increase their numbers
and to retain the friendship of the people, inscribed
their relatives and friends, however despicable might
be their social condition. There was even a greater
abuse. The chancellors, who kept the book of gold,
inscribed names at their pleasure. In 1560 the names
of three families were ordered to be erased, having been
entered without authority.</p>

<p>These abuses were never fully abolished until the
reforms of 1576 which entirely excluded the people
from the public offices.</p>

<p>We have seen that the reforms of Doria, practically
placed the government in the hands of the nobles.
The newly inscribed were few in number; and things
were so arranged that the old patricians always had
the control in the administration. This created a new
element of discord in the hatred which sprung up between
the old and the new nobles. A profound
rancour diffused its virus through the body politic, and
clanships grew strong and fought hard against each
other. Nothing was wanting but names; and names
are sometimes a great power, by which to designate the
opposing factions. The names were found, and the old
nobles were called the <i>Portico of San Luca</i>, and the
new, <i>Portico of San Pietro</i>. Both epithets were derived
from the places where the hostile factions were
accustomed to assemble.</p>

<p>The new men, finding that they could not triumph<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
by weight of numbers in the public councils, resolved
to attempt secret ways to their end. They managed
so well that in 1545 they secured the election to the
Dogate of Giovanni Battista de Fornari.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The faction
of San Luca raised a great outcry of indignation, but
in vain. De Fornari, a new noble, stepped over their
heads into the highest office. They remembered the
humiliation, and afterwards avenged themselves upon
the new Doge.</p>

<p>From what we have said it will be seen that the
laws of Andrea, far from restoring the Republic, sowed
new seeds of discontent between the nobles, so concordant
in their discord, and the people over whom
they ruled.</p>

<p>Doria, Admiral of Cæsar, conqueror by the arms of
his lieutenants in so many battles, and owner of more
than twenty galleys, concentrated all power in the
hands of the old nobility, whom he made blindly devoted
to his interests. It is no marvel that he directed
at pleasure the ship of the Republic. Without the
name, he possessed the supremacy and honours of a
prince. Men called him the Father of his country and
the Restorer of liberty. What we have said shows the
nature of the liberties which he gave the State, and they
will be further illustrated in the progress of this history.
He loved his country; but he spent all his long
life in establishing a stable despotism in the room of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
tumultuous liberty. He loved his country; but obeying
the orders which he received weekly from Cæsar,
he enslaved that country to Spain. On the contrary,
the Republic had always better consulted her interests
by standing in a neutral attitude between contending
princes.</p>

<p>Ottaviano Sauli gave eminent proof of such political
wisdom when the Republic sent him as its envoy to
the Duke of Milan, and he brought back and enforced
by his advice the counsel of that prince, to keep neutral
and resist the influence of Cæsar in Genoa. The
government preferred this policy, and in its letters to
the English king, to Venice and to Florence, openly
avowed that its chief care was to live in freedom;
that it knew the advantages of neutrality, and would
not bow to the will of others; that its single aim was
to strengthen and maintain its integrity and its policy
of supporting the independence of the other Italian
Republics.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>These were generous words, and they were supported
by deeds. But Doria willed the supremacy of Spain,
and he triumphed. Then Genoa, in the siege of Florence,
favoured the enemies of Italy; even threw a lance
at Siena; extinguished in blood the revolt of Naples,
and, with the arm of Doria, strangled everywhere the
voice of national liberty.</p>

<p>From that moment the robust vigour of the Republic
began to decrease, and the shadows of old age
fell on her. The lifeless forms of the court of Spain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
took the place of our civil strifes and our heroic achievements
abroad.</p>

<p>Doria, though naturally disposed to temperate and
modest habits of life, gradually developed the pomp and
state of a prince. He lived in Fassolo, in the houses
once given to Pietro Fregoso for his brave deeds in
Cyprus (1373). Doria called from every part of Italy
the most famous architects to embellish this palace.
The sculptures of Montorsoli and of Giovanni and
Silvio Corsini da Fiesole, the paintings of Pierin del
Vaga, Pordenone, Gerolamo da Trevigi, Giulio Romano
and Beccafumi rendered this residence famous throughout
Italy. Here he was surrounded by his own soldiers,
and received, writes Mascardi,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> not as a simple
citizen, but as a proud grandee. The same author
ascribes to this luxury of life the origin of the conspiracy
of Fieschi; and he approves ostracism by republics
of citizens who affect the manners of princes.</p>

<p>These mimicries of royalty gave general dissatisfaction;
but the selection of Gianettino di Tommaso as
his adopted son and his successor in the dignity of
Admiral, was even more unpopular.</p>

<p>We find notices of this young man which represent
him to have once, on account of the slender means of
his father, kept a shop for the sale of oil. Afterwards
he entered the service of Bernardo Invrea, a silk-weaver,
and remained with him until, being pursued
by the sheriff for some offence, he found it necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
to seek safety on board the galleys of Andrea, to whom
he was allied by blood.</p>

<p>Taking up from necessity the profession of arms,
Gianettino soon acquired a considerable name for warlike
feats marked by enterprise and audacity. He
possessed an intrepidity rather singular than rare. He
soon became haughty and despotic putting on airs fitter
for a Castilian than a Genoese, and decorating himself
with a coat of arms as though supreme authority were
already in his hands. The prince, instead of correcting
these excesses, permitted the arrogant youth to lord it
over the plebeians and to indulge his wild caprices at
pleasure.</p>

<p>Count Filippino Doria, as we have seen, contributed
to the fame of Doria. He was of humble fortune until
the Duke of Urbino, as a mark of gratitude for having
perilled his life to succour the duke in a single combat,
conferred upon him an estate of the Urbino family.
Some other members of Doria’s house, who had been
schooled under him, gave good proof of their skill and
acquired riches and honours which reflected lustre on
their master. Such were Francesco Doria di Giovanni;
Antonio Doria, marquis of Santo Stefano, Aveto and
Ginnosa, and one of the principal generals at the victory
of San Quintino; Giovanni Battista Doria, son of
Antonio and heir of his valour; Giorgio Doria, and
Domenico Doria who having abandoned the cloister
was called the <i>Converso</i>.</p>

<p>To these we should add, Andrea Doria d’Alaone;
the brothers Cristoforo and Erasmo Opizio, who as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lieutenants of Andrea went in 1534 to the aid of Messina;
Giorgio di Melchiorre; Imperiale di Bartolomeo,
lord of Dolceaqua; Lamba di Alaone; Lazzaro di Andrea;
and Scipione di Antonio, all in repute as brave
Admirals; and they sailed so many ships and gained so
many victories that it seemed as if this family claimed
exclusive dominion of the seas.</p>

<p>When Andrea prepared for any enterprise he commanded,
in addition to the <i>triremes</i> of the empire, not
less than twenty <i>taride</i> or large galleys of his own,
manned by his own officers and crews and paid by the
emperor at the rate of five hundred broad ducats of
gold per month for each vessel. He took with him,
also, the ships of the Republic, and those of his relations
and of other citizens who chartered their <i>panfili</i>, or
vessels of sixty oars, to the emperor of Spain. At the
assault of Prevesa the prince commanded, not to speak
of square-sailed galleons and caracks, twenty-two triremes
whose names we find set down in the chronicles
of that period.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Antonio Doria, who was only less
illustrious in naval warfare than Andrea&mdash;though, as
Badaero wrote in his report to the Venitian senate, he
was so fond of traffic that, when his ships passed from
one port to another, they carried so much merchandise
that they looked like merchantmen&mdash;had six vessels in
his division. There were many other Genoese ships in
this expedition. Two belonged to Onorato Grimaldi,
lord of Monaco; two were the property of the Cicala,
and one each of Centurione, Preve, the Gentile and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
Francesco Costa, not to speak of many others. The
Fieschi also sent a vessel, and the Republic furnished
twelve.</p>

<p>In fact there was no distinguished family which did
not arm a ship, but not one of these houses could rival
Doria, not even the Cicala who always kept not less
than six galleys in commission. It is worth while to
remind the Italians, who are so prone to forget the
glory of their ancestors, that Andrea was the first to
use armoured ships in battle. In his assault on Tunis,
he had in his fleet a galleon called Sant’Anna, to which
he was principally indebted for the victory which
restored Muley-Hassan to his throne. This ship was
the first ever clad with slabs of lead fastened by pivots
of bronze. She was built at Nice in 1530, and was
equipped by the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.
She was manned by three hundred warriors and carried
many guns. The solidity of her armour rendered her
invulnerable to the enemy’s fire. There were a large
chapel and sumptuous saloons under her decks, and
what seems more strange, ovens so well arranged that
they furnished her crew with fresh bread daily.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>The Republic having broken with France, was prostrated
under the power of Spain and Doria. The
citizens were profoundly indignant at this double servitude.
They were prohibited by law, under the severest
penalties, from proposing or advocating any change in
the new constitution of the Republic; so that many,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
before the attempt of Fieschi, ardently wished to throw
off the yoke and place the country once more under
the protection of France. In 1534, Granara and Corsanico
went to Marseilles followed by many of the
people with the intention of preparing a revolution.
The enterprise became known by Doria, and Granara
lost his head. Corsanico was captured by Doria,
and, without the least form of condemnation, hurled
into the sea.</p>

<p>A few months later, Tomaso Sauli who had attempted
a similar conspiracy with Cardinal di Agramonte, in
Bologna, was condemned and quartered. The exiles
excelled all others in their devotion to liberty; and in
1536, led by Cæsar Fregoso and Cagnino Gonzaga,
with ten thousand foot and eight hundred horse, they
marched to attack Genoa. This is not the place to
relate how after a few skirmishes they broke up their
camp; it is only to our purpose to add that hundreds
of citizens who were suspected of complicity with the
exiles lost their heads, while their houses were levelled
with the earth.</p>

<p>Not only in Genoa, but throughout Liguria these
conspiracies abounded; especially in Chiavari, where
the revolt of Fregoso, of which Stradiotto was the
leader, had its origin. Blood whenever it was shed, far
from quenching the thirst for liberty, begot new advocates
for the old supremacy of the people. Soon after,
that is in 1539, a pious priest named Valerio Zuccarello,
beloved by the people, was accused of revolutionary
sympathies and leanings to France. He was subjected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
to an inquisition and lost his head on the scaffold.
The nobility struggled to maintain its power; the
people to regain the inheritance of which they had been
defrauded. The Republic was passing through such
pains as these when Gianluigi Fieschi listened to her
complaints and resolved to avenge them.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Maria</span> Grasso della Rovere, the spirited niece of Julius
II. after the death of Sinibaldo removed from the city
to her castles, first to those in Pontremoli and Valditaro
where she gave birth to Scipione, and then to Montobbio
where she established her residence. In those days our
matrons, when their husbands were fighting abroad or
when they became widows, took active charge of their
estates and, laying aside all elegant recreations, employed
their zeal in promoting their family fortunes. From
this came the masculine counsels and splendid examples
which illustrated their history. Of such was
Maria della Rovere, daughter of the Duke of Urbino.</p>

<p>Emancipated from the luxury and pomp of her
Genoese life, she applied herself, like a good farmer’s
wife, to restore the fortunes of her house and to pay
the large debts of Sinibaldo, especially the twelve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
thousand ducats of gold due to Sforza for the feud of
Pontremoli. Her chief care, however, was the education
of her children. The eldest of them, Gianluigi,
was ten years of age at the death of his father. The
others were Gerolamo, Ottobuono, Camilla (who became
the wife of Nicolò Doria, illegitimate son of
Cardinal Gerolamo), Angela, Caterina, and Scipione,
born after his father’s death. There was in addition a
Cornelio, who though illegitimate (his mother was a
certain Clementina of Torriglia), was much beloved on
account of his spirited character. Some report that
Sinibaldo had other illegitimate children, and number
among them a Giulio and a Claudia, the latter of whom
married into the family of the Ravaschieri.</p>

<p>The children were instructed by Paolo Panza, a man
of many literary acquirements, who trained them in
liberal studies.</p>

<p>The ardent spirit of Gianluigi imbibed less from the
gentle instructions of Panza than from the masculine
promptings of Maria della Rovere, who, in the fashion
of Spartan mothers, exhorted him not to forget the
paths by which his ancestors reached fame, contending
as Guelphs for the rights of the people. Influenced by
such counsels, he grew up into youth, and acquired
strength both of body and mind in rough exercises of
arms and in the chase. He was so skilful in these arts
and in swimming, that the most robust of his rivals
could not excel him. His mother taught him to hate
the rule of strangers; and he must very early have
become an enemy to the Dorias, whom he saw grasping
the destinies of the Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was eighteen years of age he took charge
of his patrimony, which the prudence of his mother
and the address of his guardian, Paolo Pansa, had so
much improved that it is said to have yielded two
hundred thousand crowns of rent. On the fourth of
June, 1535, Charles V. confirmed his title to the domains
of his ancestors, and continued in him the titles
of Vicar-general in Italy, Prince of the empire, Count
of the sacred palace, and imperial councillor. Perhaps
it was on that occasion that he also received from
Cæsar the two thousand gold crowns mentioned by
some writers.</p>

<p>On coming to the city from Montobbio, he was honoured
with festive receptions by all the nobility; his
manners and his gentle courtesy acquired him the love
of the best among the people. Bonfadio<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> describes
him as beautiful of countenance, skilful in the use of
arms and the management of horses, remarkable for
the beauty and strength of his body, manly in speech,
grateful, obliging and winning to others: in fine his
sweetness of character and vivacity of temper completes
the picture of an Alcibiades, formed for captivating all
hearts. In fact he was called an Alcibiades, and perhaps
he was one, the vices included; it is certain that
in patriotism he deserved the name. It is said that
when, mounted upon a bay saddle-horse, caparisoned
with orange-coloured velvet trappings laced in vermillion,
and poitrel of silver, he rode through the narrow
and crowded streets of Genoa followed by his valets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and equerries, the people gathered from every side to
do him honour, and he repaid them all with a salute
full of winning courtesy. He dressed with the luxury
which had come down to him from his illustrious
ancestry. A picture, which many believe to be that of
Gianluigi, represents him in a black velvet morning
gown having the sleeves slashed, as was the fashion of
the time; there is a collar about his neck with cannon
shaped points, and a chain from which hangs a
medallion bearing the motto <i>Gatto</i>. His head is
covered with a cap, also of black velvet, surmounted
on the left side by a white plume. The limbs are
comely and chaste, the air brave and courteous, the hair
of a mulberry tint, the hands white with fingers long
and clean as those of a virgin, the eyes black and
brilliant. Leandro Alberti describes him as a prudent,
brave and eloquent young man. Porzio<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> writes that
he served not without honour in the wars of Lombardy
under the standards of the marquis Vasto. But
though fond of glory and successful in arms, he scorned
to seek fame in other enterprises while the times
forbade him to use his sword for national liberty.</p>

<p>Endowed with such gifts, there was no illustrious
family which did not seek his hand for a daughter.
Among the beautiful damsels who in every part of Italy
were ambitious of the title of Countess of Lavagna, he
fixed his eyes upon Ginetta, daughter of Prince Adamo
Centurione. In every maidenly grace she was unrivalled.
The prince and his wife Oriettina, who loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Gianluigi, were delighted to expouse Gianetta to the
most virtuous knight in Genoa. However, difficulties
arose which overthrew the project; and as the misfortunes
of Fieschi begin from this disappointment, we
deem it of importance to touch upon some circumstances
which were unknown to, or have been ignored
by historians.</p>

<p>The Prince Centurione was a firm supporter of the
Austro-Spanish rule, and was united to the Dorias. He
had fought, as a volunteer and at his own expense, in
the wars of Charles in Germany; and his vast wealth
procured him favours from the principal monarchs.
When the emperor passed through Genoa, his minister
asked Doria to lend the royal visitor two hundred
thousand crowns, for his enterprise against Algiers.
The Genoese responded that he would immediately
supply his sovereign with all the money he might need.
He presented the money to the emperor and with it a
receipt for its payment. The emperor, not wishing to
be outdone in generosity, tore the receipt in pieces.
Prince Adorno also lent two hundred thousand crowns
of gold at one time to Duke Cosimo. He paid eight
hundred thousand pieces for the marquisate of Steppa
and Pedrera, in Spain, and a large sum to marquis
Antonio Malaspina for the estates of Monte di Vai,
Bibola and Laula. He bought other castles in the
Langhe; and the Venitian ambassadors reported that
his rents amounted to a million of ducats.</p>

<p>Memoirs worthy of credit relate that Centurione one
day informed Andrea that he had contracted Gianetta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
in marriage to the first gentleman in Genoa, and named
Fieschi; to which Doria answered that no gentleman
in Genoa could rank higher than Gianettino, his
successor in the admiralty and heir of all his possessions,
adding that Centurione ought to renounce Fieschi and
give the hand of his daughter to the prince’s nephew.
Centurione did not at first consent to break his faith;
but the solicitations of Andrea, with whom he did not
wish to be at enmity, at length triumphed over his
scruples and he espoused Gianetta to Gianettino giving
her a dower of seventy thousand gold crowns of the
sun.</p>

<p>This violation of plighted faith deeply wounded
Gianetta who had set her affections on Gianluigi; and
the Princess Oriettina took it so much to heart that
she fell sick, and finding herself near death, as a last
proof of her devotion to the Fieschi family had that
life of St. Catherine written which is still preserved in
manuscript in the library of the Genoese studio. This
broken contract of marriage was the first spark of that
great fire which blazed up between Fieschi and Doria.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>The count was gifted with great powers of dissimulation
and he did not permit Doria to perceive that he
felt the insult. He carried an open face and silently
matured his vengeance. He contracted greater familiarity
with the new nobles, the old being devoted
partisans of Andrea.</p>

<p>The haughty arrogance of Gianettino added new
fuel to the fire. This youth forgetful of the humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
place from which he had risen, adopted an insolence of
tone and a luxury of life which gave general offence.
The natural insolence of his character had been greatly
increased by a military life and the habit of command.</p>

<p>The control of twenty galleys, the succession as
admiral and the proofs of personal courage which he
had given raised him above the mass of the citizens;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
but instead of knightly courtesy he had a scornful and
imperious look, and he never entered the city without
being attended by a cortège of officers and armed men.
He affected in a free land the sumptuous customs of
princes.</p>

<p>The people, whom he thrust aside, hated him; the
nobles caressed him as a means of getting privileges
and honours, but they secretly despised him because
he, not content to be their equal, regarded them as
subjects. The plebeians murmured; “why such
arrogant assumption in a land whose laws forbid
despotism! He who refuses to treat you as an equal
wishes to make you his slave.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> See how bravely he
drives it towards princely powers?”</p>

<p>Thus the people abhorred Gianettino as its future
tyrant, and longed for a favourable moment to strike
down the Spanish power and restore the rule of the
citizens. The old prince either encouraged or regarded
without displeasure, the insolent habits of his heir
which were bringing odium upon his house. Gianettino
became unboundedly arrogant after his victory over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the Corsair Dragut, or Torghud Rais, once governor of
Montesche. The annals of Liguria give us but few particulars
of this fight, and some modern writers believe
that no such battle was ever fought. We have found
in old chronicles the materials for correcting the errors
and supplying the defects of those who have written
upon the subject. This will not lead us beyond the
range of our subject; since the honours showered upon
Gianettino for this victory stimulated Gianluigi to
illustrate his own name by deeds not less worthy of
fame, while the pride of the young Admiral grew so
high that he insolently treated the count as his
inferior.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1539, Prince Doria was with the
army in Sicily, and Torghud took advantage of his
absence to make a piratical cruise in the Ligurian sea.
Andrea, as soon as he received notice of the movement,
sent his nephew to oppose the Corsair. The latter had
already began his depredations along the coast, and
had desolated Capraia, carrying off seven hundred
prisoners and a large Genoese galleon. Gianettino,
having a fleet of twenty galleys and a frigate commanded
by a certain Fra Marco, acted upon his
knowledge of the Corsair’s habit of beating up against
the wind, and pursued him by the use of his oars. At the
same time he sent his lieutenant, Giorgio Doria, with
six galleys and the frigate to the bay of Giralatte where
he believed the pirate to have run for shelter. His
calculations proved to be accurate. Torghud, believing
these galleys to be the principal fleet of the Genoese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
left two vessels to guard his booty, and sailed to attack
Giorgio Doria with nine ships, two of which he had
captured from the Venitians at Prevesa.</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of the engagement, Gianettino,
who was not far distant, sailed into the waters of
Giralatte and joined his lieutenant. The Corsair seeing
himself outnumbered, retired from the contest and
endeavoured to escape; but Gianettino pursued him so
closely that he soon saw flight to be impossible and
resolved to sell his life as dearly as possible.</p>

<p>He raised his oars to the sound of trumpet and
tymbal, according to Barbary customs and accepted the
battle. The numbers and weight of vessels were equal,
and both parties had equal enthusiasm, courage and
obstinacy. But a cannon ball from a Genoese galley
opened the side of the corsair’s flag-ship, and a tempest
of fire battered the rest into shapeless wrecks. Some
of the pirates flung themselves desperately into the
waves, and others turned the prows of their shattered
vessels and attempted a new retreat. Among the latter
was the terrible pirate Mami Rais de’ Monasteri, in
Africa who had once before been a prisoner of Antonio
Doria and had been liberated on payment of a ransom.
Giorgio pursued him now without success; but with
this exception the whole fleet was captured including
the two vessels left by Torghud to guard his booty.
These last were captured by Count Anguillara who
was fighting under Doria’s flag.</p>

<p>The losses of Doria were small, but that of the
enemy was terrible, since every one of them who swam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to shore was mercilessly put to the sword by the
Sicilians. Torghud was made prisoner and the chronicles
say that “after having been well flogged he was
put in chains.” He offered without avail fifteen thousand
ducats for his ransom.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of June 1539, at vespers, Gianettino
entered the port of Genoa with the galleys captured
from the corsair. The citizens flocked in crowds to
welcome the victors and two thousand christians who
had been delivered from captivity, and to see the
humbled lord of the main.</p>

<p>Torghud managed with such tact that he obtained
admission to the presence of the Princess Peretta, and
addressed her in proud and threatening terms of reproach
for the harsh treatment which he had suffered;
but he soon adopted a humbler tone and begged to be
sent to Messina, where Andrea Doria still remained
with his army. This favour he obtained, and he renewed
to Andrea his offer of a heavy ransom, but still
without success. A few years after, his countrymen,
who valued him highly as a commander, offered new
terms, and this time Andrea yielded to the temptation.
The commission had not a sufficient sum to pay the
ransom, and borrowed it in Genoa from the noble
family Sopranis, giving as security the island of Tabarca.
Thus Torghud, conquered by Genoese arms and ransomed
by Genoese gold, recovered his liberty and
renewed his piracies on the seas to the detriment of
all Christendom.</p>

<p>It is needless to say that the success of Gianettino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
aroused a spirit of emulation in Count Lavagna. But
he saw that the Dorias, accusing him to Cæsar of revolutionary
opinions, had shut him out from honours
and official position; and, not wishing to employ his
talents in strengthening the Spanish power in Italy,
he sought repose for his active spirit in domestic enjoyments.</p>

<p>He married Eleonora, of the family of Prince Cybo,
though his mother at first strongly opposed the alliance,
preferring for her son a more wealthy and illustrious
bride. By this marriage Fieschi came into a certain
relationship to Catherine de’ Medici, wife of Henry II.,&mdash;Catherine
Cybo, duchess of Camerino and aunt of
Eleonora, being of the blood of the Medici, and therefore
of the queen of France.</p>

<p>The marriage contract was prepared on the 15th of
September, 1542 in Milan by Galeazzo Visconti and
Gerolamo Bertobio, notaries, in the presence of
Francesco Guiducci and Giuseppe Girlandoni, representative
of Cardinal Innocent Cybo (the same to whom
Philip Strozzi bequeathed his blood to be made into a
pudding) and of Lorenzo and Ricciarda Cybo, on the
one side, and Paolo Pansa the attorney of Count
Fieschi on the other. The dower amounted to hardly
nine thousand gold crowns of the sun and two thousand
more for the wedding outfit. The Strozzi papers
contain an act under date of January 18th 1543 written
by Bernardo Usodimare-Granello, scribe of the archepiscopal
court of Genoa, by which Count Gianluigi
acknowledges that Rev. Ambrogio Calvi, attorney and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
agent of Cybo, had paid four thousand gold crowns of
the sun and deposited five thousand more with the
brothers Giuliano and Agostino Salvaghi who had
become securities for the dowry. The act further
acknowledged the payment of one thousand crowns for
jewellery and ornaments and provides that the other
should be furnished by Cybo in silver, gold and gems.
In the same act, Count Fieschi pledged as security for
the dowry the castle of Cariseto and its appurtenances,
which he had obtained by purchase, and he promised
to obtain the consent of Cæsar to the transfer of the
estate within one year from the date of the instrument.</p>

<p>The preparations for the wedding and the festivities
connected with the espousals were on a splendid scale.
The flower of the Genoese nobility came to congratulate
the spouses at their residence in Vialata.</p>

<p>Two powerful families possessed the magnificent hill
of Carignano, the Fieschi, and the Sauli. Each family
had there a splendid palace. During the minority of
Gianluigi, silence had reigned in his, while that of the
Sauli had been greatly enlarged and embellished.</p>

<p>The Sauli were new nobles belonging to the popular
party, like the Fieschi, Farnari, Promontori and Giustiniani;
yet few of the nobility, old or new, equalled
them in wealth and gentility of blood. Marcantonio
Sauli, a grave priest, whose life Soprani wrote, had
splendidly adorned his palace, and there the Genoese
ladies were wont to meet for pleasure, and the elders
of the city to debate on the affairs of the Republic.</p>

<p>At the marriage of Gianluigi, his palace resumed its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
ancient gaiety, and the Sauli, surpassed by the Fieschi
in magnificence, were filled with envy; and this was
the first cause of those differences and rivalries which
separated these distinguished families.</p>

<p>Louis XII., who had been the guest of the count’s
grandfather, speaking of the sumptuousness of the
palace in Vialata, said that it surpassed that of his own.
And the palace of Fieschi was in fact a kingly residence.
The annalists tell us that the hill of Carignano,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
on which it stood, was adorned with fifty villas, houses
and gardens. The principal of these were the palace
of Madonna Marisla, the mother of Cardinal Sauli,
those of Nicolò, Giovanni Battista and Giuliano Sauli,
and the houses of Pietro Negrone and Rolando Ferrari.</p>

<p>From the summit of this hill you have a commanding
view of the city, and of the port crowded with a
forest of masts; the villas of Albaro are spread out
before you; gardens and palaces cover the slopes of
gentle declivities, or are scattered along the sides of
the mountains which, swelling skyward, make at once
a rampart and a diadem for Genoa. Valleys and slopes
of marvellous beauty attract the eye towards the shore
line, fringed with orange gardens, of Nervi and Recco,
until Portofino, with its wave-washed rocks, closes on
that side the charming basin of the gulf; while westward
lie the bewitching shores of Voltri, Albissola and
Savona, closed in the long prospective by Cape Noli
standing boldly in the face of the sea; and throughout
the wide horizon the waving surface is white with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
cities, castles and villages, which are garlanded round
with orchards and olive groves, reflecting their verdure
in the crystal mirror of the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the centre of this smiling scene, roofed with a sky
yet more bewitching than the landscape, rose the palace
of Count Fieschi, faced with alternate slabs of white
and black marble, crowned with two grand towers, and
decorated with emblems and statues on its front and
sides.</p>

<p>In the <i>Fogliazzi Notarili</i>, which are preserved in
the city library, there is an instrument dated March
30th, 1468 executed by Luca and Matteo Fieschi, sons
of Daniel and Ginevrina Fieschi, from which we learn
that in front of the palace there lay an open lawn
extending towards the sea, that the villas and orchards
of the estate covered the whole space as far as San
Giacomo. On the east, west and south the grounds
were bounded by public streets, and on the north lay
the farms of Francesco del Monte and of the heir of
Oberto Della Rovere. Subsequently to the date of this
instrument, Bartolomeo Fieschi added villas and fields
to this estate; but on the southern side it suffered
some detriment from the opening of stone quarries by
the government for which the Doge Battista Fregoso
paid damages in 1479.</p>

<p>We also learn, from the records of <i>Bailia della
Moneta</i> in the bank of St. George, that sixty citizens
having, on the 21st of March, 1484 engaged, to extend
the mole of the harbour twenty-five or thirty goe (a goe
was ten palms or nine feet) the Doge and the elders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
authorized the rectors of the commune to quarry stone
on private property, and for this purpose some lands
were ceded by the same Bartolomeo Fieschi, thus
decreasing the extent of his estate southward, though
it did not reach the sea before this cession.</p>

<p>Behind the palace, lay a botanical garden which
Sinibaldo had enriched with rare species of plants and
beautified with little lakes and fountains making it,
according to Spotorno, among the first of its kind in
Italy.</p>

<p>Sinibaldo employed excellent architects and builders,
whose names have not come down to us, to decorate
and enrich his home, some time before Paul III., on his
return from Nice, lodged here as Fieschi’s guest. The
wrath of man, rather than the hand of time, has so
completely destroyed these monuments that not even
the ruins remain for our admiration. The reader will
therefore receive with favour the results of our researches
into the true position and boundaries of the
Fieschi palace and gardens, which in their time were
famed for their outward magnificence and for the
sculptures, carved work and pictures within the palace.
Of these works of art all but one have perished from
the memory of man. This was a painting in the
vestibule which treated the fable of the giants hurling
thunderbolts at Jupiter and some enterprises of the
Fieschi family. We think it just to inform our readers
of its origin and character.</p>

<p>The wealthy citizens of Genoa were accustomed,
like those of every part of Italy, to adorn their mansions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
with paintings allusive to the exploits of themselves
or their families. For example, history has preserved
the memory of an allegory given to Gerolamo Adorno
by Paolo Giovio, which was sketched in colours by
Titian, and wrought into a rich embroidery by Agnolo
di Madonna, a Venitian embroiderer. Giovio, in his
brief dialogue, speaks of three emblems which were
painted in many places in the Fieschi palace. The
bishop of Nocera writes that Sinibaldo and Ottobuono,
with whom he was on familiar terms, asked him to
execute an allegorical picture, representing the vengeance
they had taken for the death of their brother,
Count Gerolamo, whom the Fregosi had cruelly murdered.
This revenge had removed from among the
living the instruments of the deed, Zaccaria Fregoso,
Signors Fregosino, Lodovico and Guido Fregosi. With
this bloody reprisal the Fieschi satisfied their anger,
saying that no Fregoso lived to boast that he had
spilled the blood of a Fieschi.</p>

<p>Giovio represented this tragic vengeance by an elephant
attacked by a dragon. The latter attempts to
wind himself about the legs of his antagonist, so as to
pierce his bowels and insert his deadly poison. But
the elephant, knowing by instinct the danger to which
he is exposed, turns himself round and round until he
places a rock or a tree between himself and his enemy.
Then he beats the dragon to death. This allegory was
interesting, from the fine contrast of the two animals,
and the Spanish motto, <i>No vos allabareis</i>&mdash;by which
Fieschi would say to the Fregosi, “You cannot
boast of your crime against our blood.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Sinibaldo had another allegory executed in the palace
of Vialata. He and Ottobuono were forming an
alliance with the Adorni and many of their partisans
urged them to protract the negotiations, since the army
of the king of France was near at hand and Ottaviano
Fregoso, supported by his party, had a very firm hold on
the government and would be able to make a spirited
defence if assailed at that moment.</p>

<p>To this the Fieschi replied that they well knew the
time for action, and on this incident they asked Giovio
to execute an allegory. The artist remembering what
Pliny says of the halcyons who await the spring solstice
to make their nests and lay their eggs when the waves
are tranquil, painted a calm sea and a serene sky with
a nest extending from the prow to the poop of a vessel
with the heads of the halcyons raised over the prow
and a motto in French&mdash;<i>nous savons bien le temps</i>&mdash;meaning
to say we well know when to make war on
our adversaries; and the chronicler adds, they thus
foreshadowed their triumph over their rivals.</p>

<p>The Fieschi palace had other allegorical paintings
treating various subjects. Some of them described
tender love passages in the lives of the Fieschi. In
one was told the story of a gentlewoman loved by Sinibaldo.
It would seem that she grew jealous and reproached
him with want of fidelity, because he mingled
much in the company of other dames. Sinibaldo, in
order to excuse and justify himself with his mistress,
demanded of Giovio an appropriate representation in
allegory. The artist represented a mariner’s compass
lying on a chart with the needle fixed; overhead a blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
sky spangled with golden stars, and underneath the
motto, <i>aspicit unam</i>. The sense of this allegory being
that, though the heaven is full of beautiful stars, the
needle points to one alone, that is, the North star. The
offended dame was cured of her jealousy. The allegory
was much praised, says Giovio, by many persons,
including Fieschi’s secretary, Paolo Panza. We have
already said that the elect of the city came to congratulate
Gianluigi on his return to Carignano, and
that the luxury displayed by him on the occasion of
his marriage surpassed all bounds. Some conception
of this luxury may be formed when we remember that
Genoa was at that time the richest city in Italy, and
that its wealth found expression in a prodigality of
money so excessive, that Partenopeo in an assembly,
at the time Giovanni Battista Sauli entered upon the
magistracy, prayed the government to impose restrictions
on the waste of the national wealth. In fact,
on the 16th of December, 1500, the elders issued a
proclamation forbidding wives to spend on their personal
attire more than a third part of their dowers,
and ordained other sumptuary prohibitions.</p>

<p>The flower of the Genoese youth frequented the
Fieschi palace, not merely for amusement and pastime,
but they cultivated there letters and polite studies.
Liguria had at that period some erudite scholars, who
employed themselves in teaching youth the sciences
and eloquence. The Fieschi did not rank last in these
pursuits; and it had become a family tradition for the
sons to cultivate letters, and acquire the doctorate in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
law. Gianluigi was versed in every branch of learning,
and, though it has been written that he never had
other books in his hands than the life of Nero and the
conspiracy of Catiline, it is certain that he studied the
Latin and Italian masters, especially Tacitus and
Machiavelli.</p>

<p>Paolo Panza, who wrote the lives of the pontiffs of
the Fieschi family, and graceful Latin and Italian
verses of such merit that Ariosto compared them to
those of Trissino and Molza, lived in the house of
Gianluigi, and aided him in his literary pursuits.
Through his instructions the young count acquired a
love for learning, and was led to open his doors to the
most cultivated men of his time. And these were
more numerous than might be expected in a city
immersed in commerce and maritime enterprises.
Braccelli and Antonio Gallo had acquired repute as
historians: Giacobo de’ Fornari, as a Greek scholar:
Geronimo Palmaro, Bartolomeo Guistiniano, Nicolò
da Brignali and Bartolomeo were men of great learning,
and Grimaldi Rosso, who reached the dogate in
1535, was equally master of medicine, mathematics,
and philosophy.</p>

<p>These noble examples were followed by Nicolò Senarega
Gentile, a renowned lawyer, Marcantonio Sauli,
and P. Ilarione, who wrote learnedly on the subject of
exchanges. We omit Ansaldo Ceba, who was both a
warrior and a poet, because he lived somewhat later;
but we must mention Emanuele Grimaldi, whose
pleasing rhymes were published in 1549; Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
Alessandro Spinola, whose literary merits were eclipsed
by his fame in the field, and particularly that obtained
at Golletta, where he was the first to mount the hostile
ramparts. Among our warrior poets we should not
pass by the brave Cesare Fregoso, though he had been
killed a few years earlier by the Spaniards. He wrote
Latin songs which were highly praised, but have
unfortunately been lost. He was a man truly great
in everything. Matteo Bandello, who took shelter in
his palace, and received from him both protection and
honour, bears testimony which is alike honourable to
both protector and protected. But it would be beyond
our province to enumerate all the learned men of that
period.</p>

<p>Perhaps the reader will be pleased to know something
of the famous women who surrounded the
countess Eleonora. She was herself, instructed in
letters, as well as in all those accomplishments which
became a lady of her time.</p>

<p>Among her friends were Arcangela di Negra, and also
the venerable Battista Vernazza, daughter of the great
Ettore, from whose pen we have treatises, songs and
epistles.</p>

<p>Among the latter her answer to Doctor Tomaso dal
Moro, who had endeavoured to win her to the
doctrines of Luther, then being secretly diffused
through Liguria, is singularly charming. Bandello
mentions with praise an Antonia Scarampi,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> and we
may add Peretta Scarpa-Negrone, whom her contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
commend for her skill in poetry, calling her a
new Corinna. Livia Spinola has left us good rhymes;
Maddalena Pallavicini, wife of the marquis of Ceva,
wrote verses which are not without merit, and Placida
Pallavicini won the encomiums of Paolo Foglietta.
The first rank in the Pallavicini sisterhood is due to
Argentina, who became the wife of Guido Rangone,
and whose literary accomplishments were the theme of
the wisest men of that period.</p>

<p>Gerolamo Ruscelli da Viterbo, a literary man of high
repute among his contemporaries, tells us that the
greater part of the Genoese gentlewomen cultivated
belles-lettres; and in an epistle which he published in
1552, he enumerates among the most rare women of
Italy twenty-three of Genoa and six of Savona. He
mentions among the first of Genoese ladies, Pellegrina,
Lercari, “a virgin not less virtuous than beautiful,”
and Nicoletta Centurione-Grimaldi, on whom he
lavishes every sort of praise. Among those of Savona
he speaks of Leonora Falletti, countess of Melazzo, as
one whose happy compositions had stimulated the
ambition of many learned men. Among the poetesses
of Liguria, are also to be numbered Benedetta Spinola,
daughter of Alfonso marquis of Garessio, and wife of
Giovanni Battista, prince of the blood of Savoy and
lord of Racconigi; Claudia della Rovere, countess of
Vinovo in Piedmont; and Caterina Gastodenghi, who
enjoyed the praises of Dolce, Parabasco, and many
others.</p>

<p>The gentle consort of Count Fieschi held the central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
place in this circle of cultivated gentlewomen; but
unfortunately the rhymes of Eleonora, which gave her
so much credit with her contemporaries, are no longer
in existence. The few specimens of her talent which
remain to us give ample proof of her genius. They
were published in Turin in 1573, with the verses of
Faustino Tasso, a Venitian, and of three other poetesses,
of whom one belonged to her husband’s house, that is,
Ortensia Lomellina de’ Fieschi. The others were Nicoletta
Celsa and Laura Gabrielli degli Alciati,
Eleonora was not inferior to her aunt Caterina, duchess
of Camerino, who knew Hebrew, Greek, and Latin,
and who found comfort when Paul III. deprived her
husband of his possessions, in the friendship of wise
men and in philosophical studies.</p>

<p>But the genial studies, the love and charms of his
wife, did not enervate the manly spirit of the count.
At every step his mother’s voice reproached him for
attempting no daring enterprises. From the towers of
his palace he saw Genoa lying at his feet and seeming
to call him to deliver her. He looked out upon the
sea and saw it whitened with the sails of Gianettino,
his rival and the expected despot of his native land. A
sense of magnanimous indignation warmed his bosom.
The son of Sinibaldo, the heir of such an illustrious
house, could not endure the sight of his country sitting
under the shadow of a foreign power, if not enslaved,
certainly not free.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">According</span> to our belief, a single idea directed the
movements of the Peninsula in the first part of the
sixteenth century&mdash;the thought common to all the
people of emancipating the country from that foreign
power which was corrupting the national character,
literature, and art. Classic and courtly history has
found in these stormy years only local and isolated
conspiracies; few writers, we might almost say none,
have heard, in these risings of peoples crushed under
the ambitions of the great, the mighty groan of a
dying nation not yet resigned to her terrible fate.</p>

<p>The national Guelph tradition refused to yield place
to the new imperial system which was slowly destroying
the old charters of the communes. There were
generous throbs which showed that the old body politic,
though sore wounded, still contained the breath of
life; every city of Italy on the verge of the grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
rose up with the last strength of an expiring man,
protested with blood, and died.</p>

<p>Palermo protested in her hero Giovanni Squarcialupo
whose death consecrated her cause; she renewed her
life in the patriotism of the Abbattelli, who could not
turn back her destiny. Naples was lit up with insurrection.
Milan, always foremost in magnanimous
enterprises, raised her head, when Morone incited the
marquis of Pescara against the emperor, and that
nobleman first promised to lead the revolution and
then betrayed it to the tyrant. Perugia in vain set
up the banner of the Republic; Florence fought, Siena
renewed the memory of Saguntum, and Lucca burned
audacious fires of civil and religious liberty. There
was scarcely a city or village which did not recall its
Latin traditions, and combat the monarchical power
which was descending like a tempest on the whole
nation.</p>

<p>The blood which was poured out like water did not
profit our cause. Some died in battle, some lost their
heads on the block, and others preferred banishment
to being witnesses of the national degradation. Hospitable
Venice, who alone was clean from the Spanish
leprosy, opened her doors to the fugitive patriots, and
they, having broken their swords, continued to protest
with their pens. Italian statesmen had good reason
to struggle against the growing importance of the
house of Hapsburgh, whose only enemy was France
then barely escaped out of her contests with feudalism
and with the English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Donato Gianotti, the successor of Machiavelli, as
secretary of the Florentine Republic, wrote a wonderful
address to Paul III., in which he urged that Genoa
should be redeemed from the hands of the Dorias and
Spaniards, and the republic and principalities bound
in alliance with France, as necessary measures for the
defence of national liberty. The object of this discourse,
so rich in political wisdom, was to warn the
Italians of the danger of neglecting their own interests.</p>

<p>“They cannot,” he says, “secure their safety except
by making preparations to take up arms against that
power <i>which can only secure itself in its possessions
by enslaving all Italy</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Gianotti urged the importance
of tempting the confederates of the emperor, and,
if possible, enlisting them in the national cause, and
adds: “The State of Genoa under the authority of
Andrea Doria, ought to be reconciled to the King of
France; and I do not believe the Genoese would be
disinclined to it, for their sympathies are for France,
and they know the advantages to a Republic of independence
and the free use of their political power.
It was useful to the Genoese, at the moment, to follow
the influence of Doria and, ceasing to be French, to
become imperialists, as a step towards liberty; but at
present it would not be less useful to them to unite,
without altering the form of their state, with the other
governments of the Peninsula.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Gianotti expressed the hope that the Pope’s authority
might induce Doria to risk his fortunes with those
of Italy, and he thinks there could not be obstacles on
the part of the French monarch, because political prudence
would counsel him to ally himself with Genoa,
without seeking to govern her as a subject province:
“rather,” he adds, “the French king should refuse to
govern Genoa, as such power would involve most embarrassments
for himself. The French king should
make allies of the Genoese, solely in order to detach
them from his enemies.” He makes a similar suggestion
to all the Italian states, especially Siena and Florence,
“who for common interests ought to make common
cause.” He argues that such a policy would free these
states from that dependence on the empire, which some
believed necessary to their existence, and would give
them the repute of being able to live without leaning
on foreign support. He advocates the policy which
adjusts itself to the conveniences and changes of the
times, and enforces this reasoning by the conduct and
aims of the Emperor which left the Italians no hope
but in war. He advises that arms and munitions both
of offence and defence be acquired with as much haste
as possible; that friendship be cultivated with foreign
powers. “<i>Peace</i>,” he concludes, “<i>may be more fatal
than war</i>, for the former must in the end subject us to
despotism, while war may fortify our present liberties
and restore those of which we have been defrauded.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>This apparent digression upon the discourse of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Florentine statesman is very much to our purpose, and
that his counsels were warmly welcomed by the Count
Lavagna is manifest, for his scheme is moulded upon
Gianotti’s plan. The Florentine laid down three rules
of policy,&mdash;That our provinces, especially Genoa, break
with the Emperor; that they form alliance with
France&mdash;not to put themselves in her power, but to
keep her from becoming their enemy,&mdash;and that, without
seeking material aid from France, all the Republics
should make vigorous preparation for war against the
empire.</p>

<p>On these principles Fieschi constructed his too-much
calumniated plot. Those who have written about it,
without studying the character of the times, rather as
romancers than historians, have transmitted us a fable
that he sought the supreme control of the Republic;
but he sought no other end than to bring back the
government to its ancient principles. Revolution in
Genoa never aimed at enslaving the people. In those
centuries we had foreign generals and ministers among
us, but never absolute rulers; and if these ministers
attempted tyranny, they paid for their audacity with
their blood, like Opizzino d’Alzate, or were expelled,
like Trivulzio and others.</p>

<p>Gianluigi was not so short-sighted as not to know
the temper of the Genoese, or to forget the lesson of
then recent examples. He sought not to usurp the
government and become the oppressor of the people,
but to confer on his native land the blessings of its
ancient order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Though writers in the pay of Spain accused him of
corrupt ambition, lust of gold and thirst for blood, it
is time to render him the tardy justice of saying that
no document can be quoted which proves that he
cherished such infamous projects&mdash;projects alien to his
gentle and humane character, to the traditions of his
family, and to the spirit of the Guelph party then supported
by the most sound and cultivated intellects of
Italy.</p>

<p>Sismondi alone, of all historians, seems to us to have
comprehended the real object of Fieschi. “Andrea
Doria,” he writes, “had restored the name of Republic
to his country, but not liberty nor independence. He
called to the government a strict aristocracy, of whom
Gianettino was the master. He bound the fate of his
country to that of Austria, by bonds which humiliated
the best part of the Genoese. Fieschi planned his conspiracy
in order to deliver the country from the yoke
of Spain and the Dorias.”<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The events we proceed to describe set the seal of
truth upon the words of this illustrious historian.</p>

<p>Some tell us that Gianluigi plotted, so early as 1537,
with Cesare Fregoso, to place the Republic in the
hands of the French king; for which, Bonfadio adds,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
he would have lost his head, if Andrea Doria had not
saved him from the rigours of the law. This report
was set on foot by the marquis Vasto, governor of
Milan, who, after the assassination of Cesare Fregoso<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and Antonio Rancone, the messengers of King Francis
to Soliman, endeavoured to justify his treachery by
declaring, among other things, that he had found in
commentaries of Fregoso, (which he never had in his
hands) proofs that Fieschi took part in that plot. But
these pretended conspiracies with the King of France
are now destroyed by very authoritative testimony.
If Bonfadio had remembered that, in 1537, Fieschi
was still a lad, he would have hesitated to adopt that
slander. It is known, too, that personal enmity existed
between the families Fregoso and Fieschi of so
bitter a character as to forbid all possibility of common
political views and intimate secret negotiations. The
memory of the day, when Doge Giano Fregoso and his
brother Fregosino, encountering Gerolamo Fieschi,
killed him with many blows, was not effaced; nor was
it forgotten that the Fieschi retired to their castles to
plan their revenge, collected three thousand soldiers
and besieged the city from the valley of Bisagno,
where the Fregosi were entrenched. A battle was
fought, in which the Doge was defeated. The Fieschi
entered the city as victors, killed Zaccaria Fregoso,
dragged his corpse through the populous streets, and
elevated Antoniotto Adorno to the office of Doge.
From that day a mortal hatred had divided the two
families. This fact alone renders the story of a plot
with Fregoso highly improbable.</p>

<p>Bonfadio also accuses Fieschi of having attempted
to betray the city to Pietro Strozzi, which, he says,
would have been done, if Bernardino di Mendozza had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
not arrived with a strong body of <i>Bisogni</i>, in good
time to overthrow the conspiracy. Some add that the
count sent one Sacco, to Strozzi to instigate him to
attack Genoa and to act as a guide. The circumstance
deserves investigation.</p>

<p>In August, 1544, when the emperor had marched
into France, Pietro Strozzi collected an army at Mirandola,
with the design of attacking the territories of
Milan in concert with Enghein. Aided by Pierluigi
Farnese, he had already crossed the Po, and entered
the province of Piacenza, where he lay encamped on
the slopes of the Ligurian mountains, when, being
assailed by Ridolfo Baglione and imperial troops sent
from Naples, he was forced to fall back to Serravalle,
on the banks of the Scrivia. Here he was overtaken
by the prince of Salerno, and forced to accept battle.
The fight was at first favourable to Strozzi, but in the
end he suffered defeat. There were few killed, because
the Italians recognized their brotherhood on the field
of battle, threw down their arms and embraced each
other. Strozzi took shelter with the remnant of his
army in the territory of the Republic. The Fieschi,
fearing the rage of a conquered Strozzi, and perhaps
an assault upon Montobbio, fled into the city, and
remained there until Strozzi evacuated his camp in the
Apennines. This shows how completely Bonfadio
was in error.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>Though, however, the count of Lavagna (then lord
of thirty-three castles) had no secret correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
with Fregoso nor Strozzi, he certainly had political
relations with other persons; and this is what remains
after eliminating the falsehoods spread abroad by
Spain.</p>

<p>Having formed the purpose of deposing the old
nobility and restoring the popular government, Fieschi
saw that his best policy was to follow the fortunes of
the Adorni, whose party his ancestors, and especially
his father, had zealously supported. The views of
Gianluigi found an echo in the breast of Barnaba
Adorno, count of Silvano, of whom we must briefly
speak.</p>

<p>Silvano is situated in the Val d’Orba in Monferrato,
two miles beyond the Giovi. On the east and west
lie the villages of St. Cristoforo, then a feud of the
Dorias, of Montaldeo&mdash;honored as the birth-place, at
a later period, of cardinal Mazzarino&mdash;and Mornese, a
feud of the Serras; on the south lay Cremolino, possessed
by the Dorias; and on the north the castles of
Carpineto, and Montaldo, and the city of Alessandria.
Nearer and almost contiguous to Silvano stood the
castles of Lerma, Tagliolo, Ovada, Rocca Grimaldi,
Capriata, and Castelletto Val d’Orba, also feuds of
Barnaba Adorno.</p>

<p>Silvano was fortified by two large and strong towers,
and was the usual residence of Adorno, who had
strong friends and political allies in all the castles and
villages around him. He devoted his early years to
arms, and, rising to the rank of colonel under Cæsar,
he acquired distinction in Provence and in the kingdom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of Naples. In the latter he obtained the feud of
Caprarica. Weary of the tumults of war, he retired
to his home and married Maddalena, daughter of the
Doge Antoniotto Adorno. In beauty, this woman was
excelled by few persons of her time.</p>

<p>The quiet of Adorno was disturbed by serious quarrels,
especially by one with count Paolo Pico of Mirandola,
who attacked his lands and put Castelletto to
fire and sword. This strife, so bloody in the civil war
which it inflamed, was not less spirited before the
tribunals of the empire; but it is not our province to
enlarge on its many vicissitudes.</p>

<p>Adorno cherished the design of cultivating the
popular party, and so raising the declining fortunes of
his house, and he soon began to attempt plots against
the new order in Genoa.</p>

<p>In this purpose he turned to the count of Lavagna,
through the mediation of a Fra Badaracco, and, after
many debates, it was resolved to unite their forces for
the overthrow of the Dorias. Barnaba was to be
elevated to the Dogate, and the count to govern the
eastern Riviera as his father had done before him.
They further agreed to place the Republic under the
protection of France, without prejudice, however, to
its liberties, and solely to secure it from the vengeance
of Cæsar. Fra Badaracco, in order to find partisans, held
conversations with some gentlemen whom he supposed
to be dissatisfied with the government of the Dorias.
But these persons exposed the matter in the senate:
the friar was arrested, and some letters of Barnaba<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Adorno were found on his person. After having been
tortured, Bardaracco was decapitated, having confessed
that, besides Adorno, Gianluigi Fieschi and Pietra
Paolo Lasagna were concerned in the conspiracy. The
senators, not being able to obtain proofs of their guilt,
decided not to prosecute the conspirators.</p>

<p>Having thus failed in his first effort, the count
sought new paths to his end. He saw that it was
necessary to have an understanding with the king of
France, as a means of restraining the army which the
emperor had in the territories of Milan, and to secure
the capture of the fleet of Doria, which was the chief
prop of the imperial power. It was plain that these
naval and military forces would easily quell any insurrection,
unless the troops of France in Piedmont were
directed to hold the army of Cæsar in check. Gianluigi
was induced to enter into an understanding with
France by one of his relatives by blood, of whom we
ought briefly to speak, because his name has been
almost forgotten in our domestic histories.</p>

<p>A branch of the Fieschi family, expelled from Genoa
in 1339, had taken up its residence in Piedmont and
acquired there both possessions and honours. A
certain Giovanni Fieschi&mdash;made bishop of Vercelli by
Clement VI., in 1348&mdash;gave a share of the temporal
government of his diocese to his brother Nicolò, and
conferred upon him some lands and castles.</p>

<p>We find in the archives of the court at Turin that
the Fieschi ruled in Masserano until 1381, and that
Nicolò, Giovanni, and Antonio formed an alliance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
count Verde. Some few years later, or in 1394, Lodovico
Fieschi, also bishop of Vercelli and cardinal,
petitioned Boniface IX. for the repayment of a large
sum of money spent by him in maintaining the rights
of his church, and he obtained permission to alienate
from the jurisdiction of the church the castles of
Masserano and Moncrivello, and to confer the feud
upon his brother Antonio. This investiture was confirmed
by subsequent popes, especially by Julius II.;
and Alexander VI. added, in 1498, the feuds of Curino,
Brusnengo, Flecchia, and Riva, assigning them to the
brothers Innocenzo and Pier Luca.</p>

<p>The first of these had a son named Lodovico, and
this Lodovico a daughter named Beatrice, whose hand
her father gave to Filiberto Ferrero, a citizen of Biella,
adopting him as a son.</p>

<p>The Fieschi possessions in this way passed into the
family of Ferrero; and he, having obtained for his son
Besso the hand of Camilla, niece of Paul III., secured
the investiture of Masserano, then created a Marquisate.
Whoever is desirous of learning how these feuds came
into the possession of the Ferreri to the exclusion of
the male line, and particularly of Gregory and Pier
Luca Fieschi, may consult <i>Curzio Giuniore</i>.</p>

<p>This Pier Luca II., lord of Crevacuore, where he had
an excellent mint, of whose coinage some specimens
are preserved to us, constantly revolved revolutionary
projects, as a means of recovering his lost dominions,
and urged Count Gianluigi to proclaim himself a
partisan of France. It is certain that by the advice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
of Pier Luca, Gianluigi bought the Farnesian galleys,
of which we shall presently speak.</p>

<p>The count received Pier Luca at his house in Vialata
with every mark of affection, and lent a willing ear to
his suggestions; but fearing that France would wish
to reduce Genoa to the condition of a French province,
he resolved to ascertain the views of the ministers of
that power, and to obtain pledges for the security of
popular liberty.</p>

<p>He entrusted this negotiation to Gian Francesco,
(called Gagnino) Gonzaga of the family of the dukes
of Sabbione, a brave soldier, hostile to the empire.
With his uncle Frederick he had fought against Cæsar
at Parma, and later as a colonel of the Florentines in
the celebrated siege of Florence. Being an open partisan
of the French, he was banished from his native
land.</p>

<p>Gonzaga presented himself before the French council
of state, and reminded the ministers of the many
services which the Fieschi family had rendered to the
French crown; he showed clearly that the only means
of driving the Spaniards from Lombardy, was to
destroy the communication with their other Italian
states: and the first step to this end would be to
remove from power in Genoa the faction of the Dorias.
Fieschi, he added, could accomplish this more easily
than any other person, and he would attempt the
enterprise if France would encourage his efforts, and
promise not to lay violent hands on the Republic.</p>

<p>Doria had many enemies in Paris. Though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Chancellor Du Prat was dead and the constable Montmorency
was fallen, yet the animosities awakened by
Doria in that court were not buried. Delfino still
remembered that Doria had taken Genoa from the
dominion of France and he meditated vengeance.</p>

<p>The count of San Polo had not forgotten that
Andrea caused his defeat and captivity at the battle of
Landriano, by informing the Spaniards of the difficulties
he was encountering in his retreat. Cardinal Tournon
was unable to pardon Doria for throwing many
obstacles in his way when he went to Rome to attend
the conclave assembled to elect a successor to Clement
VIII. Admiral Annebaut hoped to command the army
to be sent for the conquest of Lombardy as soon as the
revolution should break out in Genoa.</p>

<p>Thus all the ministers, actuated at once by personal
and political motives, favoured the plans of Fieschi.
Gonzaga was welcomed with delight and obtained a
solemn promise that the crown of France would
renounce all pretensions to the government of Genoa.
He was also empowered to make use of the French
troops in Piedmont in garrison at Turin, Moncalieri,
Savigliano and Pinerolo; and to select in the port of
Toulon such ships as might be adapted to serve the
purposes of Fieschi.</p>

<p>This negotiation, securing the coöperation of France
without compromising the independence of the
country, is highly creditable to Gianluigi and shows
the keenness of his political vision which forecast all
the dangers and complications of foreign assistance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Perhaps he listened too hopefully to these promises of
foreign succour; but if French diplomatists then deceived
him, he afterwards showed that he lacked neither
courage nor will to undertake his revolution without
their coöperation.</p>

<p>France was at that time prodigal of flattery to Italy.
She drew from us her luxury, her arts and the embellishments
of her life; perhaps also her vices which she
repaid to us with usury. She had apparently no
schemes for the overthrow of the Italians, and sincerely,
though not disinterestedly, sought our emancipation
from the Spanish power. We are indebted to her for
restraining Cæsar from destroying among us even the
name of liberty; and this explains why our Republics,
our people and our first intellects were so friendly to
France. Whatever secret designs she may have
cherished, she promoted popular franchises in Italy.
She encouraged agriculture and commerce, and in war
for the most part abstained from pillage and carnage,
so that the people butchered by the Spaniards cried out,
“Would that the French were here to liberate us from
these miscreants!”</p>

<p>Some tell us that the Count, besides the aid promised,
received an annual sum from France and that he was
also salaried by Cæsar. But we have never found any
credible testimony for such statements, and the authors
seem to have spun them out of their own fancies or
received them upon the faith of partisan writers. They
should be consigned to that mass of idle rumours or
malevolent slanders which we have set aside. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
similar cloth is the fable of the journey of Ottobuono,
brother of Gianluigi, to Paris, and also to Rome to ask
justice for a grave injury inflicted upon him by
Gianettino.</p>

<p>In the mean while, Gianluigi lost no opportunity of
making partisans. The times were propitious. The
Duke of Piacenza, wishing to restrain the license of the
nobles published a proclamation requiring them to
reside in the city. This command offended not a few
who were feudatories, but not subjects, of the duke.
Among these were the Borromeo of Milan, who
possessed Guardasone in the province of Parma, and
the Fieschi who held Calestano. Gianluigi sent a
message to the duke asking that the order might be
revoked in his favour. His request was granted, and
he went in person, ostensibly to thank the duke and
render him homage as his feudatory, but in reality to
treat for the purchase of the Farnesian galleys, a
measure recommended by Pier Luca as necessary to
the contemplated revolution.</p>

<p>To conceal his true intent he wrote to the Senate, on
the 28th of September, 1545, that he was in Piacenza
to pay homage to the duke, and that he found nuncios
coming there from all the Italian provinces. He therefore
advised that the Republic should also send a representative.
The Senate followed his advice, and
charged him with the honourable office.</p>

<p>Although the galleys of which we have spoken had
already been asked for by Pietro Strozzi, by Prince
Adamo Centurione, and by Cardinal Sauli, for a nephew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
who had already paid a part of the price, yet the duke,
knowing the use Gianluigi intended to make of them,
gave him the preference. The purchase was effected
on the 23rd of November, 1545. The galleys were
named the <i>Capitana</i>, <i>Vittoria</i>, <i>Santa Caterina</i> and
<i>Padrona</i>, and had on board, in addition to arms and
equipments, three hundred persons condemned for life,
one hundred and eighty-five for various terms of years,
and one hundred and eighty Turkish and other slaves.</p>

<p>The price amounted to thirty-four thousand gold
crowns, to be paid in several instalments; one third
on delivery of the vessels, another on Lady day, 1546,
and the last one year later. The deferred payments
were secured upon the feud of Calestano, with the
consent of Gianluigi’s brother Gerolamo, who was
lord of that property.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The contracting parties were,
on one side, Paolo Pietro Guidi, president of the ducal
chamber, and Giovanni Battista Liberati, the duke’s
treasurer; and the Count of Lavagna on the other.
We must not omit, among the conditions of the sale,
that three of the galleys were to remain for two years
longer in the service of the Apostolic See, Count
Fieschi receiving the Papal bonds held by Orazio Farnese.</p>

<p>The low price of the galleys is explained by this
condition, in virtue of which they were bound to remain
in the port of Civita Vecchia, and the count was
obliged to provide for the maintenance and pay of the
officers and crews without deriving any advantage from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the ownership. Gianluigi assigned the command to
Giulio Pojano, who had also commanded them under
Orazio Farnese when the emperor undertook the war
of Algiers.</p>

<p>We are not able to decide with certainty whether,
after this purchase, the count went to Rome, as some
affirm. We find however that Duke Pierluigi, having
proclaimed a tournament in Piacenza to take place on
the 21st of February, 1546, and requested that the
ladies of his feudatories should also attend, the countess
Eleanora, as well as many others, complied with the
invitation and was presented by her husband to the
duke, who now treated Gianluigi as his equal.</p>

<p>Duke Farnese announced another tournament for
the autumn of the same year, to celebrate the marriage
of Faustina Sforza with Muzio Visconti Sforza, marquis
of Caravaggio. At this festival the flower of the
Italian nobility was gathered together; and in the
tournament of the 20th of October, 1546, Nicolò Pusterla
and Count Fieschi obtained the highest honours.</p>

<p>It is not known what means the duke intended to
employ for carrying out the contemplated revolution.
Perhaps both Fieschi and Farnese were yet undecided.
It is not impossible (we have strong testimony for the
theory) that they waited, with the hope of enlisting on
their side one who had even more audacity and
strength than themselves, and who would have brought
no mean forces into the alliance.</p>

<p>One of those reformers who makes centuries glorious
was maturing a scheme of greater scope than that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
of Fieschi. Francesco Burlamacchi, born of a noble
house in Lucca, had conceived the lofty design of revolutionizing,
under popular auspices, the Tuscan cities
oppressed by Cosimo; allying them to the still surviving
republics of Lucca and Siena; embracing in the new
nation Perugia, which since 1540 had maintained itself
under popular government against the Papacy; taking
away from the Apostolic See the temporal power, and
restoring the church to the consecrated poverty of the
Gospel.</p>

<p>He confided in the popular discontent at domestic
and foreign tyranny, and not less in the reformed doctrines
which were advocated by the most distinguished
Italians, especially by those of Lucca. He proposed
his scheme to his friends and sought partisans among
the Florentine exiles, the faction of the Strozzi, and
even among the German Lutherans who had at their
head Phillip Landgrave of Hesse, and Frederick, duke
of Saxony. Impatient of delay, he went in person to
Venice, then the asylum of the Tuscan and Genoese
exiles, and solicited their coöperation. He made an
arrangement with Leone Strozzi, prior of Capua, by
which the latter agreed to support the enterprize; but
Strozzi thought it wiser to procrastinate until the result
of the Germanic war should be known.</p>

<p>Burlamacchi, having been created commissary of
ordnance at Montagna, resolved to undertake his daring
enterprize without waiting longer for foreign aid. He
intended to rouse the people to arms, march rapidly
upon Pisa&mdash;whose fortress, commanded by Vincenzo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
del Poggio, would be opened to him without bloodshed&mdash;to
capture Florence, and thence spread the generous
fire of liberty over the Peninsula.</p>

<p>The revolution was planned with great prudence and
all contingencies were amply provided for. Unfortunately,
however, he was obliged in the exercise of
his office as Confaloniere of justice to issue a proclamation
against one Andrea Pezzini who was cognisant of
the conspiracy. This person in order to gratify his
malice, revealed the whole scheme to Duke Cosimo.
The government of Luca, mortally terrified by the Pope
and the emperor, arrested Burlamacchi, in August
1546, and obtained from him by torture a confession
of his revolutionary designs. Luca consigned him to
the imperial ministers by whom he was beheaded in
Milan.</p>

<p>Some confused and scattered papers which we have
seen imply that there were messages and interviews
between Gianluigi and Burlamacchi, and this corresponds
with that which Adriani has written of the
Lucchese revolutionist, viz: that he had formed friendship
and made allies in every part of Europe. It is
then very probable that he sounded Count Fieschi,
whose enmity to the Spaniards was well known, as
one whose great wealth and numerous dependents
would greatly reinforce the revolution. Fieschi was
often at his castle in Pontremoli and it would have been
easy for the two to hold secret interviews without
awakening the least suspicion. It is possible that
Fieschi though satisfied of the good faith of France,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
believed that nothing could be attempted in Italy
without her active coöperation or, being a Guelph,
disdained to embark in a scheme for the overthrow of
the temporal power of the Papacy.</p>

<p>These first plots of Fieschi confute the charge, disproved
by other and more direct evidence, made by sacred
college of Padua, that he conspired against the government
of the Dorias with the sole object of destroying
Gianettino who was paying court to the countess of
Lavagna.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Alexander Farnese</span> was elevated to the Papal throne
under the title of Paul III., not so much for his personal
talents as by the influence of his sister Clara whom he
rewarded, as tradition reports, by giving her poison.</p>

<p>The old Alexander VI., having by accident made her
acquaintance, was inflamed by her charms with an
ardent passion, and found means to open his heart to
her. The cunning Farnese at once saw the delirium of
the gray-headed pontiff and did not yield to his solicitations
until he had promised her brother a cardinal’s
hat. When the time for making the nomination
approached, the Pope was disposed to fulfil his pledge;
but he found a spirited resistance in Cæsar Borgia, who
having never kept faith with any one was very
unwilling that the holy father should abide by his
promises. The name of Abbott Farnese was cancelled
from the list and another inserted in its place. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
eve of the ordination of the Cardinals, Clara, suspecting
what had happened, passed a night with the pontiff
and when he, drunken with lust and wine, fell into a
profound slumber, she searched his papers and ascertained
the truth of her suspicions.</p>

<p>Being an adept in copying and reckless of consequences,
she rewrote the list, counterfeiting the Pope’s
handwriting, and placed the name of her brother first
on the roll. On the morrow, she put on all her
seducing charms and detained her paramour in his bed
until messengers came to inform him that the concistory
was assembled and only waited his presence. Clara
had foreseen that, if he were called in haste, he would
have no time to look over his papers. In fact, he
entered the concistory and gave the list to the secretaries
without looking it over. His surprise was great
when the name of Farnese was read out; but he preferred
silence to the exposure of his senile debaucheries.</p>

<p>It is not our purpose to go over the long career of
Farnese. While yet a youth he had been imprisoned
in Sant Angelo for counterfeiting a brief, and Alexander
VI. would have beheaded him if he had not contrived
to escape from prison. We shall not repeat the errors
of his contemporary historians, that he united the
black act to his astronomical learning, and that he thus,
through intercourse with demons, learned many secrets
and became skilled in political intrigues. It is enough
to say that, on arriving at the pontifical throne, he devoted
all his efforts to the aggrandizement of his family;
and, not content with obtaining the duchy of Camerino<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
for his bastard son Pierluigi, intrigued to elevate him
to the government of Parma and Piacenza, and even
raised his eyes to that of Milan.</p>

<p>It was not then a reproach, says Segni,<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> that a Pope
had illegitimate children and sought by every means
to confer upon them wealth and dignities; on the contrary,
the Pontiff who aspired to temporal grandeur
was in repute as a man of prudence and sagacity.
Paul III. intrigued for a long time with the emperor
to acquire the duchy of Milan for Pierluigi, though he
well knew that Charles, in occupying Lombardy, had
protested that he did not wish to hold it for his own
advantage but for that of Italy. In these intentions
he was confirmed by the influence of the Venitians,
the marquis Vasto and the king of France. The
Spanish monarch had already disappointed the ambition
of the duke of Orleans, who aspired to the duchy,
and he also refused it to Pierluigi. But the Pope,
after long intrigues to overcome the scruples of the
cardinals, gave his son the investiture of Parma and
Piacenza, making them tributary to the church in the
sum of nine thousand ducats.</p>

<p>This act created enmity between the Farnesi and the
emperor, though Paul III. had furnished the latter with
men and money for his war against the Duke of
Saxony, sending twelve thousand horse under the command
of Ottavio Farnese and Alessandro Vitelli. But
the increasing greatness of Charles, throwing into the
shade the prerogatives and power of the Papal See, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
disappointed hope of a principality and the league of
the emperor with England the enemy of the Papacy,
rendered Paul a bitter foe of Spain and awakened in
him the ambition to crush the imperial power.</p>

<p>Andrea Doria hated the Farnese not less cordially
than Charles. He had opposed the advancement of
this family for ten years, and had frustrated a proposed
league between the Papal See and the empire. He had
influenced Charles to refuse the duchy of Milan to
Pierluigi, and subsequently to deny Ottavio, son of
Pierluigi, the government of Tuscany according to a
promise the emperor had made when Ottavio married
his illegitimate daughter Margaret, of Austria. Doria
urged against the last scheme that if the Farnese were
made masters of Tuscany they would become powerful
enough to lay hands on the Lombard provinces.</p>

<p>There were still other motives for Andrea’s jealousy
of the power of the Farnese family. A member of the
Doria house named Imperiale being reduced to extreme
poverty had obtained an appointment in the army of
Andrea. He distinguished himself in many actions
and rose to the highest honours and wealth. But
having satisfied his military ambition he became a
priest, in which character he was first abbott of San
Fruttuoso and afterwards, through the influence of
Andrea, bishop of Sagona in Corsica. Wishing,
however, to advance his worldly interests he retired
into Apulia where he acquired many estates, and was
elevated by Andrea to the government of Melfi, in
which he largely increased his wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Before his death, remembering the kindness of Doria,
he bequeathed to him all his possessions. The Papal
nuncio seized upon and sequestrated the estates of the
bishop, claiming that they belonged by right to the
church. Andrea protested against this insult before
the Papal court, but Rome, being at once a party to
the cause and the judge of it, decided in its own favour
and issued a decree despoiling the admiral of all his
rights in the property of his relative. Paul III. fearing
the vengeance of the admiral of the empire, deputed
his nephew Alexander Farnese to offer, as a compensation
for the outrage, the power of nominating a successor
to the bishop. Doria disdained to render a vassal’s
homage to a Farnese and ordered Gianettino to assail
and capture the Papal galleys in the port of Genoa.
This capture inflamed the wrath of the pontiff, and as
an act of reprisal he arrested some Genoese who were
in Rome, threatening to confiscate their goods unless
his ships were immediately released. The Senate laid
the matter before Andrea, who answered that Gianettino
had captured the Papal vessels solely because he was
stronger at sea than his adversary. Afterwards, in
order to avoid complicating the Republic with his
private quarrel, he released the galleys of the pontiff,
after having satisfied the Farnese that he did not lack
the power but the will to revenge himself.</p>

<p>The Pope was induced by Charles V. to restore to
Andrea his defrauded rights; but the Farnese was
deeply chagrined and, not being able to strike openly
at the emperor’s favourite, sought secret ways of venting
his displeasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>Private ambition, personal mortification and political
views united to stimulate the pontiff to humble the
emperor, expel the Spaniards and crush the Dorias.
As it was obviously vain to oppose Cæsar so long as
Genoa, governed by the constitution of Doria, was
under the Spanish influence, he naturally fell in with
projects which contemplated a revolution in the
Republic.</p>

<p>It is certain, says a modern writer, that Paul was
skilled in mingling modern passions with the administration
of his venerable office. He stood between the
old world and the new, and he possessed the spirit of
both; and if the election of Clement had not deprived
him of the pontificate for ten years (as he often lamented)
perhaps the fortunes of Italy, which were not yet
desperate, might have been saved by his industry or,
at least, would not have suffered total shipwreck.</p>

<p>At that period several Fieschi families were in a
flourishing state, among them that of Ettore, of the
Savignone line, who had espoused Maria di Gian-Ambrogio
Fieschi. From this marriage were born,
Francesco, Giacomo, Nicolò, Paride, Gian-Ambrogio,
Urbano and Innocenzio. Ettore having given some of
his property in Rome to Giacomo and Nicolò, who as
priests were stationed in that city, at the death of the
first the father found it necessary to make a journey
thither.</p>

<p>Having presented himself to the Pope he was graciously
received and obtained the bishopric of Savona
for his second son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>In their conferences the Pontiff spoke of the past
grandeur of the Fieschi family, of the hospitality he
had received in the palace in Vialata in the time of
Sinibaldo, and expressed surprise that none of the sons
of Sinibaldo, whom he knew to be young men of spirit
and ambition, had sought honours in the Papal court,&mdash;honours
which could not be denied to the scions of
a noble house, which counted two successors of St.
Peter and four hundred mitred heads in its ancestry.
He also begged Ettore to inform Fieschi that he entertained
the most flattering opinion of their merits,
and should be happy to give full proof of his esteem.</p>

<p>On his return to Genoa, Ettore informed Gianluigi
of the sentiments of Paul III. and of his nephew the
cardinal towards the family, and the count resolved
personally to render thanks to the Pontiff. He visited
Rome, though dissuaded by Panza, in May, 1546 (as
Bonfadio tells us). Some maintain that he went there
at other periods, but we find no authentic evidence to
support the assertion.</p>

<p>Paul received Gianluigi in the kindest manner, and
took pains to show him honour. During their conversations
he spoke much of the ancestors of the count
as having been the first citizens of Genoa. He lamented
that the Dorias had overshadowed the family of
Fieschi. Andrea, he said, by his political tact and by
refraining from assuming in name the power which he
possessed in reality, had rendered his vast influence
less obnoxious to his countrymen, but that Gianettino
would not imitate this temperate policy nor long delay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to place his yoke on the Genoese. Count Fieschi, he
added, would be the first one humbled, as being the
most dangerous enemy to the empire. He intimated
that if Gianluigi had the spirit to oppose the Doria
ambition, the support of the Holy See would not be
wanting in the hour of trial.</p>

<p>He gave a more positive proof of his willingness to
act by proposing that the count should immediately
take command of the three galleys included in the
Farnese purchase, which still remained in the service
of the papal government, in order, said he (and he
smiled cunningly), that they may not again be captured
by Doria. This conversation, so familiar and hopeful,
greatly encouraged Gianluigi and induced him to put
his designs into immediate execution.</p>

<p>An event occurred during this visit to Rome which
nearly overthrew all these revolutionary schemes. Cardinal
Agostino Trivulzio, who, as protector of France,
lost no occasion for promoting the policy of that nation,
established relations of intimacy with Gianluigi,
and undertook to demonstrate that the difficulties of
his enterprise were such as to render it necessary to
concede to France the government of Genoa. France,
he said, would place the count at the head of the local
administration, and would give him the command of
six galleys, equipped on a war footing and maintained
at the expense of the crown, of which he could make
such use as seemed best. France would also station a
heavy body of troops at Montobbio, to prevent the
advance of the Austro-Spanish troops, and make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Fieschi captain of a cavalry force with the annual pay
of ten thousand crowns.</p>

<p>These new propositions came through Prince Giano
Caracciolo, governor-general of Piedmont, and had his
seal to their authenticity. They entirely destroyed the
previous arrangements made by Gagnino Gonzaga, and
contemplated the subjection of the Republic to a foreign
power. They did not please Gianluigi, who desired
to enlarge the liberties of his country, not to change
the masters of the Republic.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he asked time for consideration, and
without making further steps in his design he returned
to Genoa. Pondering over the difficulties of his undertaking
and the new claims of France, he would
probably have relinquished the enterprise, if Gianettino,
who, in the tone of one who held the dominion of the
waves, complained of the purchase of the Farnese
galleys, had not used such bitter and imperious threats
as to inflame anew the resentment of the count. The
success and malevolence of Gianettino, to whom as to
the rising sun all eyes were turned, fortified Gianluigi
in his determination to overthrow the expectant tyrant
of Genoa.</p>

<p>Fieschi having delayed to respond to Trivulzio, the
latter, fearing that the new propositions would discourage
the count, sent to him knight Nicolò Foderato
of Savona, a relative of Fieschi, to tell him that Francis
I. would abide by the agreement made with Gonzaga,
adding that he had only to recommend vigilance and
prudence in guiding his ship safe into port.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Gianluigi was delighted beyond measure at this
favourable turn of affairs. He subscribed the stipulations
at once and sent back the messenger with warm
thanks for the generosity of the French monarch.
Francis really desired above everything to recover his
lost dominion over Liguria, but he was persuaded to
defer that ambition to a more favourable combination
of circumstances.</p>

<p>Fieschi now exposed his plans (in this point all the
historians agree and are confirmed by the manuscripts
we have seen) to three of his most devoted friends,
Raffaele Sacco, Vincenzo Calcagno and Giovanni Battista
Verrina. He submitted to them the question
whether he should attempt a revolution relying solely on
his own forces, or undertake it in alliance with France.</p>

<p>Sacco was born of not obscure lineage in Savona,
being descended from a knight of Malta and entitled
to the annual gift of a paschal lamb. We find that a
branch of the Sacco family living in Genoa had been
united to the family of Venti, and not long after, in
1363, to that of the Franchi. Sacco was auditor and
judge in the feuds of the count and knew intimately
the feelings of his master. He advised that the French
arms be accepted&mdash;an opinion partly explained by his
being of Savona. Your forces, said he, are too weak
to oppose those of Doria and the emperor; and though
it may be easy to capture the city by a <i>coup de main</i>,
it will be impossible to hold it unless you are promptly
reënforced by a good body of troops.</p>

<p>Vincenzo Calcagno was beloved by Gianluigi for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
long and faithful services. After the warmest protestations
of his fidelity and obedience as a vassal, he
spoke at length of the evils of civil war and foreign intervention
which must follow from an attempt to change
the government. He enlarged on the difficulties of the
enterprise. Doria had twenty galleys. The sea coast
and nobility were his. Foreign rule was hateful to the
Genoese, but above all that of France. Francis occupied
by home politics, embarrassed in Lombardy and
in Naples, would not bestow a thought on Genoa if he
did not hope to acquire his lost power over her. The
nobility are in power and hate revolution, and even the
plebeians would oppose a new order of things unless
proposed by a noble. The people are unwilling to
obey men without high rank, accustomed not to yield
even to the nobles without desperate necessity,&mdash;and,
stimulated by recent events, they would demand full
control of the government. But granted that the revolution
may succeed, no sooner would the new state
be created than the crests of Adorni and Fregoso
would be seen in the foreground.</p>

<p>These powerful families, still beloved by the people,
would never consent to submit the government to the
control of a species of prince&mdash;a thing they have for
centuries resisted with their blood&mdash;so that the efforts
of the count will not enhance his personal grandeur,
but only promote the interests of rival families; the
name of Fieschi will become a reproach, distrusted
by the nobles, despised by the people and hated by
Cæsar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Calcagno would have gone on to dissuade the count
from the whole scheme if the impetuous Verrina had
not interrupted him with impatience and anger.</p>

<p>The family of Verrina was originally of Voltri, and
came into the city in 1475. Stefano Verrina had enrolled
himself as a noble attached to the company or
<i>Albergo</i> of the Franchi. John Baptist Verrina di
Vincenzo, a most honourable citizen, was then living in
Carignano, though born near the church of San Siro,
not far from the count, and was managing his affairs.
Party spirit and private animosities rendered him a
violent enemy of the old nobles; and he could not
digest it that those who had long been excluded from
public offices should, through the reforms of Doria,
be invested with the entire control of affairs. He had
once been rich, but his excessive generosity had wasted
his wealth, and he was now supporting the declining
fortunes of his family upon the liberality of Fieschi.
His intellect was of a high order, his courage that of a
hero; his spirit was high and venturous, ever intent
on the loftiest designs. He had assumed for a motto&mdash;<i>The
world belongs to him who will take it</i>.</p>

<p>Verrina demonstrated with great force and eloquence
that too much had already been done to leave any pretext
for abandoning the enterprise&mdash;that retreat was
more dangerous than the battle.</p>

<p>Revolutionary schemes ought to be executed as soon
as formed. The plans of Fieschi had reached such a
stage that the only thing left was to bring them to
completion, to dare everything, to risk life itself in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
struggle. He argued that the enterprise was not difficult;
the Doria ships were idle and their crews scattered
along the coasts, the garrison of the city was
reduced to only two hundred and fifty infantry, many
of whom were vassals of the count. The people
wanted a change of government; the Senate was
sleeping in imaginary security. It was folly to procrastinate
the hour for delivering the country from the
ambition of Gianettino, when everything was smiling
upon their hopes and nothing but their own hesitation
foreboded danger.</p>

<p>He said that it was useless to ask the aid of the
French, who had been humiliated by the captivity of
their king and were getting the worse in their struggle
with Charles V., master of all Germany. The very
example of Doria proved the nature of French sympathy
for Italy. Doria had learned too well that
Francis desired to reduce the importance of Genoa by
removing Savona from her jurisdiction, and making the
latter the capital of Liguria. The count, said he, has
the means of full success. Raise the cry of popular
liberty, and thousands of swords will be uplifted for
the cause. Let Gianluigi dare to proclaim liberty to
these oppressed multitudes. Let him dare to announce
himself as their liberator. When Cæsar fell, Pompey
was not declared a rebel, but the saviour of Rome.
Let our master imitate the high example now, when
every wind is propitious; France friendly, Rome and
Piacenza ready for alliance with us, and the people
prompt for action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The arguments of Verrina overcame the doubts of
the count, and he resolved to proceed with the general
plan then worked out. He instructed Foderato to
communicate to Trivulzio his desire that the original
compact with Gonzaga be observed in every particular.
In the meantime he came into closer relations with
Paul III., by means of the Pontiff’s nephew the cardinal;
and to complete all his preparations he resolved
to go to Piacenza and confer with the duke.</p>

<p>It is of importance to observe that Fieschi, following
the counsels of Verrina, declined the proffer of French
troops and galleys. Some paint this friend of the
count as a species of demon. They tell us that he
wished to murder the nobility and appropriate their
goods, because he was overwhelmed with debts, and to
raise the count to the office of Doge, or rather to make
him the tyrant of Genoa. In truth, we find these
fables in all the historians, even in the least passionate
and partisan, who seem to have taken no pains to sift
testimony, but to have accepted the Spanish slanders
without question.</p>

<p>In a city like Genoa, but recently deprived of the
popular liberty which she had enjoyed for centuries,
the idea of destroying free institutions could not have
entered the brain of a sane politician. Neither Verrina
nor the count were so short-sighted as to believe that
an enterprise which the emperor, with the support of
all the nobles, had found impossible could be easily
executed by them. The ancient story is repeated in
our times. The victors have written the history of the
vanquished with the sword.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>This seems to us the place to describe an atrocious
deed, which shows, on the one hand, the great affection
of the count for the members of his family; and,
on the other, how deeply he felt injuries and how
terribly he avenged them. The tragedy of which we
now speak still lives in tradition on the spot where it
was enacted. We have drawn the history of it from
old documents, which agree in general with the account
written by Bandello, who received it from the lips of
Catando d’Arimini, an intimate friend of Gianluigi.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>We have already stated that Sinibaldo had, besides
his legitimate children, a son named Cornelio and a
daughter named Claudia. This daughter was beautiful
and attractive in person and manners. While yet very
young she was married to Simone Ravaschiero di
Manfredi. He was a rich and influential citizen of
Chiavari and desired a family alliance with the Fieschi,
in order to secure their assistance against count Agostino
Lando, with whom he was contesting the jurisdiction
of a castle in the duchy of Piacenza. The
marriage was celebrated with the splendour to which
the Fieschi were habituated, and Claudia took up her
residence in Chiavari, acquiring through the purity of
her life and the charms of her conversation the admiration
of all who knew her. Giovanni Battista Della
Torre, one of the most high-born and wealthy citizens
of the district, paid her such assiduous court that she
soon perceived the object of his attentions. She
defended herself with dexterity and disappointed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
hopes of her admirer. The young man, beside himself
with his foolish passion and consuming with
amorous fires, studied to find some means of obtaining
by stratagem that which had been denied to his love.</p>

<p>He chose the occasion of her husband’s absence in
Genoa to adjust his accounts with Gianluigi, and, by
bribing a servant, penetrated into the chamber of
Claudia and concealed himself under her bed.</p>

<p>The lady was accustomed, when her husband was
absent, to require her maid before she retired to rest to
examine all the corners and hiding-places of her apartments;
and on that evening, as if presaging the
danger which was near, ordered the servant to make
careful search whether any one was there concealed.
The maid looked under the bed, and, seeing a man
hidden there, uttered a loud cry, at which Claudia
leaped from her couch and ran into her father-in-law’s
room. The old man roused his servants, armed them
and went to take vengeance on the violater of his
domestic dominions. But Della Torre, finding his
plot had failed, leaped from a window of considerable
height, and, falling, received severe bruises and
wounds. Nor would he have escaped, if some neighbours
who heard the noise of his fall had not come to
his relief and saved him from the fury of Manfredi,
by bearing him away to the house of one of them.</p>

<p>On the following morning Manfredi sent swift messengers
to inform his son and Gianluigi of what had
happened. The count was terribly enraged, but he
concealed his anger and waited to know the nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Della Torre’s wounds and what hope there might be
of his recovery. Learning that, though disfigured for
life, he would recover from the effects of the fall, he
called to him his brother Cornelio and his cousin
Simone and said to them: “You know, Cornelio, the
outrage which Della Torre has committed against our
sister Claudia, and I believe that if you have the
spirit which belongs to your blood you will arrange
with Simone to take such vengeance as the case requires.
I have prepared two galleys, manned by twenty well-armed
and brave men each. Set sail. Three hours
before dawn you will be in Chiavari. There, without
any delay, you will assail the house of Della Torre, and
if you tear him into a thousand pieces you will give
him that reward which his crime merits. Having
accomplished your purpose, take refuge in my castles
which are near there and of which I give you the
countersigns. Afterwards leave me to provide for
everything. Unless you discharge this duty, you,
Cornelio, will never come into my presence lest I kill
you with my own hands; and you, Simone, will be no
longer kinsman nor friend of mine.”</p>

<p>The two promised to execute his commands, and
setting sail, they arrived at Chiavari at the hour
appointed. Having landed, three of them went to the
gates of the town and asked the guardian to admit
them. Once within, the three threw out the drawbridge,
and the others, who were concealed close at
hand, thus marched in, threatening the guardians with
death if they raised an alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>They made straight for their enemy’s house, broke
down the door, rushed into the apartment where Della
Torre was sleeping and tore him in pieces.</p>

<p>Having accomplished their vengeance, they retired
to the castle of Roccatagliata, where the government
did not dare to molest them.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">In</span> monarchical states great families usually derive their
importance from the head of the nation, who overshadows
them all; but in cities ruled by the people,
every house has its peculiar position and character.
In Genoa, families had features and qualities which had
characterized them and given them a distinct history
for centuries. The Adorni and Fregosi always loved
authority; the Durazzi were distinguished for munificence;
the Serra for legal learning; the Pinelli for
indomitable energy; the Lomellini for liberality; the
Doria and Spinola for military genius. The Fieschi
had always maintained and guarded, though with a
partisan spirit, the popular franchises.</p>

<p>We find in the annals of this illustrious race a
Nicolò and a Percivale, who, as imperial vicars, granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
liberty to the Florentines and Luchesi. We find in
the long history of their political power in Genoa that
the Fieschi never struggled for supreme position as did
the Adorni, Fregosi, Spinola, and Doria. Carlo Fieschi,
as the chief of the Guelphs, was, in 1318, placed at
the head of the government, with Gasparo Grimaldi
for colleague, but he never attempted any legislative
or constitutional charges for the sake of remaining in
office. Bonfadio himself, though their enemy, declares
that, though the Fieschi surpassed in power all other
families, they never laid hands on popular rights.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
They were in Genoa what the Capponi were in Florence.</p>

<p>This reputation of the counts of Lavagna rendered
it easy for Gianluigi to obtain followers. To cover his
true designs, he made no change in his manners or life,
carried an open and jovial countenance, and studied
more than ever to promote domestic tranquility. His
palace was open to all; he was generous with his friends,
affable and courteous to every one. He courted the
rich with flattery and blandishments, the poor with
gifts. His table, spread with regal profusion, was free;
and he seemed to have no other cares besides races, the
chase and the dance.</p>

<p>He cultivated friendship with the old nobles, but had
greater intimacy with the new. The Dorias did not
complain of the count’s relations with the new nobility;
for, though his house was old and illustrious, its traditions
were Guelph, and the new patricians and the
leading popular families belonged to that party. In his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
intercourse with these persons, on whom he relied for
assistance, he spoke sneeringly of the reforms of 1528,
which had advanced the Portico of San Luca to the
highest power, created deep-rooted antipathies, and
weakened the Republic. Sometimes he showed a profound
passion, and his broken and threatening tone
conveyed a meaning beyond the import of his words.</p>

<p>Having won the favour of the rich and distinguished
popular families, he cultivated the love of the plebeians.
In this, his pleasant and familiar manner secured him
great success. He treated them as his equals, and, the
true Alcibiades of his time, he adapted himself to
their personal characteristics and prejudices. Chronicles
tell us that he watched from his towers to see if the
chimneys of the poorer classes smoked regularly at the
hour for preparing food, and sent provisions whenever
this token of a meal was missed on any roof. Such
wise generosity acquired him the affection of the people.
The foreign wars and the stagnation of trade had impoverished
a great part of the citizens, especially the
spinners and the silk operatives, then called Tuscans,
of whom there were fifteen thousand in Genoa.</p>

<p>The history of the manufacture of silk, through
which so many Italian families acquired wealth and
rank, has not yet been adequately treated. The history
of trades and crafts in the Peninsula would be a useful
work, and would show that even in the midst of the
fiercest contests of faction, commerce was always held
in merited honour and was regulated by few and simple
restrictions;&mdash;that merchants and artisans had their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
art-unions or corporations with their own laws, arms
and masters, that the trades were thus united in associations
as a means of perfecting their products and as
a security against fraud. The historian of our manufactures
would tell us that in Genoa, before 1432, the
trade of silk-weaving had its <i>capitudini</i>, or officers,
consisting of two consuls and six councillors, who inspected
the quality of the fabrics, provided for their
sale, took charge of the profits and decided upon the
complaints of the operatives. The government issued
many proclamations and made numerous laws to promote
the woollen trade; among which those of Doge
Pietro Fregoso are remarkable. He forbade the operatives,
who lived in the quarter still called <i>Borgo del
Lanieri</i>, to leave the walls of the city, or carry elsewhere
their tools and skill, under penalty of confiscation
of goods and other pains. Some illustrious men were
enrolled and matriculated in the art of silk, among them
Doge Paolo da Novi; and Gianettino Doria himself,
when his father Tomaso fell into poverty, spent his
youth among the silk-weavers of our city. The silk
operatives venerated the <i>Volto Santo</i> of San Cipriano,
a circumstance which explains the extraordinary number
of these images which are to be found in Genoa
and along the eastern Riviera.</p>

<p>Not less prosperous than the silk manufactures were
the corders and beaters of wool, also united into associations.
They gave a great impulse to traffic and
navigation. The beginnings of our civilization were
born of industrial arts. The marines artisans, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
tradesmen formed the only army of the Republic
when it made war on feudatories and compelled them
to swear allegiance to the commune. These brave
plebeians&mdash;to-day operatives, to-morrow soldiers, not
more masters of the shuttle and the oar than of the
sword, tempestuous in character but fervent in faith&mdash;created
in Genoa fruitful industries and immense social
power; and though in the fury of faction they sometimes
shed blood in the streets of Genoa, they atoned
it by giving her, through formidable fleets, the dominion
of the seas.</p>

<p>Guglielmo Embriaco, the hero of the first crusade,
is the representative of this Genoese thrift and courage.
Our armies were nothing more than associations. Such
companies subdued the Euxine. The Giustiniani captured
Scio, Samos, and other islands, and divided their
gains <i>pro rata</i> per man in proportion to the expense
which each had borne; the Cattaneo at Phocis, the
Gattilusio at Mytilene, and the Zaccaria in Negroponte.
Elis and Achaia adopted the same rule. It rarely
happened that one who was not inscribed in a trade
and to the commune obtained any position as a master-workman.
The very nobleman who was a Ghibeline
outside the walls became a Guelph when he established
his residence in the city; and though from his castles
in the passes of the Apennines he might have once
plotted to invade us, he had no sooner recorded himself
as a citizen than he counted it an honour to guide
our fleets and overthrow our enemies. There was at one
time a law which forbade the nobles to command even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a ship; and many great nobles enrolled themselves
with the people to open the path to naval and military
authority.</p>

<p>The mark of these Guelph institutions on the
people of Genoa was deep and enduring. The Genoese
of our day are living proof of their lasting influence.
Labour and banking produced immense wealth. The
Genoese became the bankers of Europe. In the year
1200 they drew the first bill of exchange.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It was
drawn on Palermo. They diffused the Arabic system
of notation. In 1148 they created, for the conquest
of Tortosa, the first public debts which they afterwards
consolidated, appropriating the city and port customs
to pay the interest. They founded the Bank of St.
George, on whose model those of England and Holland
were constructed, and they planted colonies everywhere.
Along the inhospitable coasts of the Caspian and Aral,
in Turchestan and Thibet, the pilgrim was safe in
person and property who declared, “I am a Genoese.”</p>

<p>We return from this digression to the thread of our
narrative. The long wars had lessened the gains of
our trades-people; even the silk operatives were by
the want of markets reduced to extremities. In that
year, too, food was dear throughout Italy; and the
merchants who held grain kept it back from sale in
order to raise the price. Gianluigi, wishing to provide
for the pressing wants of so many operatives, called to
him Sebastiano Granara, consul of the weavers, obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
a list of the most distressed families, and sent them
sums of money with a request to keep secret the name
of the donor, and to inform him whenever they were
again in urgent need.</p>

<p>He frequently requested the artisans and mechanics
who were natives of his lands (they were more than
two hundred) to come to him in Vialata, where he
opened to them his granaries, and otherwise succoured
them. By such acts of generosity he acquired the
favour of the people, who were ready, as a proverb has
it, “to carry water for him in their ears,” and to defend
his person at their own peril.</p>

<p>Having by such practices obtained the sympathy of
the new nobles and the humble classes who lived by
their daily labour, the count began to provide the
arms and soldiers which he should need, and, with
great tact, availed himself in the exigency of the
discords among the neighbouring governments.</p>

<p>Pierluigi Farnese, after having obtained from Paul
III. the investiture of Parma and Piacenza, soon found
that he had not sufficient forces to maintain his power
in these provinces. Gerolamo Pallavicini, marquis of
Cortemaggiore, and others of that family to whom the
duke had prohibited the trade in salt, raised an armed
rebellion. The Rossi, Sanseverino, Pusterla of Milan,
and other feudatories, were supporting the insurrection.
It was also encouraged by Giovanni del Verme, lord of
the Romagna, a personal enemy of the duke, and by
Beatrice Trivulzio, who being incensed against Paul
III. for conceding the port of the Po in Piacenza to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Michelangelo Bonaroti, excavated a new harbour, and
deprived the divine architect of his reward.</p>

<p>The duke collected an army, and, as soon as he felt
able to contest the field, demanded from some of his
enemies the restitution of his dominions in their possession,
claiming that these lands and feuds had been
ceded to them by his predecessors to the prejudice of
the ducal rights. The Pallavicini, who were particularly
included in this demand, made such preparations
as were possible to secure their own rights and repel
all the duke’s attempts at aggression.</p>

<p>The estates of the Pallavicini and Fieschi were
separated only by a little stream; and the count seeing
a war cloud on the horizon, so near to his own fields,
visited his feuds in the summer of 1546, under pretence
of watching over his property. He spent some time
at Lavagna, Montobbio, and Pontremoli. Here he
collected his dependents, formed them into companies,
and held musters and reviews. He would have gone
farther, if the emperor, fearing that the Pallavicini
dispute with Pierluigi would excite a general Italian
war, and so distract his attention from his campaign
against the Smacalda league in Germany, had not sent
peremptory orders to Don Ferrante Gonzaga, who had
succeeded to Marquis Vasto in the government of
Milan, to pacify the quarrel, threatening the whole
weight of the imperial displeasure against any who
should refuse his mediation.</p>

<p>The duke was induced to lay down his arms by the
shrewd Pontiff, who did not wish an open rupture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
with Cæsar, and Count Fieschi was chosen by Farnese
as arbiter of the rival claims. These two&mdash;Farnese
and Fieschi&mdash;had been on intimate terms some years
before, at the time when the former came to Genoa,
(1542), in company with Annibal Caro and Appollonio
Filareto, his secretaries, to pay homage to the emperor
and to ask a congress in the name of the Pope&mdash;the
congress which took place in Busseto.</p>

<p>Fieschi, mindful of old ties, conducted the negociation
with so much dexterity that he obtained from
Pallavicini more than the duke had dared to hope.
A friendly and familiar correspondence always continued
between them, as several letters we have had in
our hands prove. Among them there is one of the
3rd of February, 1546&mdash;now preserved among the
Farnesian papers in Parma&mdash;in which the count recommends
to the duke a master-workman, Giacomo
Merello, “a maker of cannon of rare skill in his profession,”
who had a law-suit with another master
workman in Parma. In these letters the count acknowledges
that he has received many favours from
the duke.</p>

<p>In their many interviews in Piacenza, Farnese, who
knew what had been said and done at Rome, spoke
freely of his hatred towards Cæsar, who had openly
favoured the Pallavicini, and who was a constant enemy
of the advancement of the Farnese family. He avowed
that he was ready to throw himself into any undertaking
which should promise him revenge. The count
in his turn, enlarged on the enmity between himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and the Dorias, the oppressors of his country, on the
plots of Gianettino, already known to him, and finally
asked the assistance and support of the duke in his
contemplated insurrection. It is needless to say that
the duke gave liberal promises of aid in a work which
would take away the influence of the Dorias, his hereditary
enemies, and doubtless add something to his
personal importance and wealth.</p>

<p>Meantime Gianluigi, who could ill tolerate delay,
enlisted in his service a large number of men, then
just discharged from the ducal army, and distributed
them among his most remote castles. Having returned
to the city, he kept Farnese advised, by frequent messengers
and letters of all his movements and successes.
Some of these letters are now passing through the
press. In one of these, dated the 17th of April, he
complains to the duke that Gianettino had given him
an order from Cæsar to send his fourth galley to cruise
for pirates; he speaks of plots woven for him by the
young admiral, and asks the advice of Farnese.</p>

<p>The Duke advised that his plans be hurried forward,
and mentioned, as a special inducement, that Renèe,
of France, duchess of Ferrara, had again offered French
aid through Pierluigi. But it is certain that the
count made no more use of this offer than he had
made of others like it.</p>

<p>We find in ancient chronicles a statement which
would be greatly to the credit of both Farnese and
Fieschi. They had, according to these writers, laid
the foundations of a league common to all the Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
princes, the object of which was to remove from the
Peninsula every vestige of foreign power; but historical
fidelity compels us to say that we have found no
document which clearly proves the fact. In July, the
count went to Montobbio, drilled his vassals in military
exercises, and put his castles in such a state of defence
as to be able to resist a long siege. He then went
through, one after another, his principal feuds. It is
worth our while to touch in passing upon the condition
of some of them at the time of which we write.</p>

<p>Passing along the Eastern Riviera from Genoa, the
count would first enter into Recco. It was then a
large borough with three hundred and seventy-four
fires, and he had built in it a superb palace called the
Astrego. He drew from this feud select mariners, to
man his galleys. He visited Roccatagliata and Cariseto,
castles of considerable strength. He added to their
defences and supplied them with provisions. We find
that he spent some time at the castle of Varzi, on the
slope of Penice, formerly one of the principal fortresses
of the Malaspini, near Bobbio. He remained longer
still in Lavagna. This region, though not then so
prosperous as it was before Frederick II., reduced it to
a desert, (1245) and levelled the fourteen castles which
the counts had built there, was yet a feud of considerable
importance, on account of its slate quarries.</p>

<p>The Lavagna property included, to say truth, only
a little group of a hundred and thirty-six houses, but
the surrounding country was adorned with many
burghs, as Centurion, San Salvatore, the earliest seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of the Fieschi family, Cogorno and Brecanecca, forming
in all five hundred and seventeen fires and six
churches. Besides the valley of Lavagna was full of
little estates and burghs, such as Torre, Vignale,
Villa Fronte, Aveglio, Cortemiglio, Rimaglio, Pregio,
Bausalo and Oneto. Lavagna was the heart of the
Fieschi dominion. From this point it was easy to
lay hands on the Lombard provinces or to draw thence
men and arms. In those days the burgh of Sestri,
close by, was one of the most busy points of transit,
and was the best station from which to send goods into
Lombardy. Merchandise was transported from Sestri
to Castiglione, and ten miles only remained to Varese,
also the property of the Fieschi. It counted two
hundred fires, and was prosperous with the trade of
Lombardy. Then, crossing the Apennines, twelve
miles of travel brought the merchant to Val di Taro, a
burgh of one hundred and fifty houses, which overlooked
forty-two villages, subject to Count Fieschi.</p>

<p>Having examined his resources and put his castles
in a state of defence, constructing strong outer walls,
for those which seemed to him to be weak, under pretence
of “fortifying himself against the Duke of Piacenza,
who was too fond of his neighbour’s property,”
he passed over to Pontremoli.</p>

<p>Leandro Alberti, who visited this noble and luxurious
castle about that period, says that it stood near the
mouth of the Magra, and at the foot of the Apennines.
It was fortified by three fortresses, and numbered eight
hundred houses, while its jurisdiction embraced forty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
contiguous burghs, not to mention the valleys of
Volpedo, Rosano, Zeiri, and the hamlets along the
banks of the Crania, which counted one thousand and
eight hundred fires. Giustiniani says that the lord of
Pontremoli could easily put under arms two thousand
men.</p>

<p>Gianluigi spent some time here, having conferences
with Count Galeotto Mirandola, the Pusterla and Cybo,
the marquises of Valdimagra, the Bentivoglio, the
Strozzi and others, who were restless under the imperial
yoke; and in these negociations he was ably
seconded by Catando d’Arimini and by Giulio Pojano,
to whom he had assigned the command of his galleys.</p>

<p>The count did not return into the city until the
end of autumn. Pierluigi Farnese, to remove all
suspicions of the plot, wrote many letters to the
Genoese government, and took great care to show his
anxiety to render every service or favour in his power.
The object of these letters, which may be said to contain
little political wisdom, was much more grave and
serious than their tone implied. The golden style of
Caro, who dictated them, gives them a certain charm;
but their highest value lies in showing how skilfully
Pierluigi and Fieschi planned and worked to elevate
their friends to office under the Doria government, to
get the control of public affairs out of the hands of
Andrea, and so pave the way to the success of their
great insurrection.</p>

<p>One fact is very important. The doctors of the
law and the magistrates of the <i>Ruota</i> always possessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
large powers in the Republic, and the practical operations
of the government depended almost entirely on
their counsels. When Fieschi had made such military
preparation as seemed sufficient for a revolution, he
naturally sought to get the lawyers on his side, as the
only class who could organize and maintain the new
government. By the aid of the Duke of Piacenza, he
contrived to place in the principal offices of the <i>Ruota</i>,
and even in the vicarate of the city, men who shared
his own political views, and were distinguished for
political sagacity and administrative ability. On the
25th of May, 1486, duke Pierluigi wrote to the Doge
and Governors that M. Hettore Lusiardo, a gentleman
and doctor of Piacenza and a person of great
learning, desired to obtain an appointment in the
<i>Ruota</i> of the Republic. And he adds, “I am greatly
pleased to see my vassals honoured according to their
merits, and I cheerfully use my influence to advance
them to such positions as they desire. On this occasion
I hope your highnesses may lend a favourable ear
to my intercession on behalf of Messer Hettore, since
in employing this person you will at once gratify me
and secure the services of a man worthy of your esteem,
as he will show when put to the proof.”</p>

<p>In another letter of December 17th, he renewed the
same request: “Writing on another occasion, I have
asked your favour for Messer Hettore Lusiardo, one of
my Piacentine gentlemen and doctors, and a person of
rare personal qualities, who desires a place in the
<i>Ruota</i> of your city. Wishing much that he may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
obtain his request, I repeat my recommendations in
the strongest possible terms; and if you can give him
such a place as he desires, you will not only serve a
person worthy of your confidence and the favour he
asks, but also do me a great pleasure.”</p>

<p>In another letter of the 24th of November, we
read: “M. Bernardo Alberghetti da Rimini, at whose
request I write, is a doctor in law of much learning,
long practice, and strict integrity&mdash;qualities which I
know him to possess, both from the reports of others
and from my personal experience, having employed
him for many months. He would still be in my service
but that I have no employment of moment for
him, and he deserves something better than a subordinate
position. He wishes to enter into the <i>Ruota</i> of
your most noble city as a means of advancement, and
hopes that my recommendation may have some value
with your Excellencies. I esteem him to be, as I have
said, a person of most excellent qualifications, and I
doubt not I shall have well served your interests in
sending him to you, and I therefore the more boldly
pray you for love of me to give him your approval.”</p>

<p>In the same year the official term of the vicar of
the city expired, and the office was of such importance
that the conspirators exerted themselves to fill it with
a person entirely devoted to their interests. On the
13th of September, Farnese wrote: “When Count
Fieschi was last in Piacenza, I warmly recommended
to him Mr. Camillo Villa, a Piacentine doctor in law,
and urged him to ask from your Excellencies in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
name the office of vicar in your city for this person.
Though I am certain that the count would not fail in
doing me this service, and believe that I may rely
much upon your courtesy to me, and though I have
recently by letter renewed my request to the count, yet
I deem it not discourteous, as the time for filling this
post draws near, to recommend Mr. Camillo directly
to your excellencies. Should you grant my request,
you will both secure to your city an officer who will
always serve you well and do me a personal kindness.”</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that Farnese obtained
from the Senate all these appointments. Secret as
were these intrigues, they did not escape the acute
eyes of Panza, who inferred that the count was engaged
in some conspiracy. He therefore took opportunities
for watching his movements and his manners; and
finding that the count withdrew from his former familiarity
with his old tutor, he was led by his affection to
admonish him of the dangers before him. But Gianluigi
broke off his reproofs with ill-concealed impatience
and answered him with the words of Cato: “If I
believed that the shirt I wear knew the secrets of my
heart, I would tear it off and give it to the flames.”
Then checking his impetuous speech, he added that he
would do nothing that should not be worthy of his
own fame and that of his ancestry.</p>

<p>Panza was not the only person to suspect the count
of some conspiracy against the power of Cæsar. John
Vega, ambassador of Spain at Rome, conceived doubts
of his fidelity, and set Ferrante Gonzaga to watch his
movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Gonzaga sent to Prince Andrea his secretary, Maone,
with the letters of Vega and other documents which
referred to a conspiracy, believed to be forming by
Gianluigi.</p>

<p>Andrea rejected the tale as the work of some malignant
slanderers, and replied that he knew Fieschi was
not a man to conspire against the empire.</p>

<p>Though the purchase of the pontifical galleys was
a sharp thorn in the side of Gianettino, who aspired to
an exclusive dominion of the seas, yet it was not an
act sufficiently singular to awaken the suspicions of
the Dorias.</p>

<p>The most wealthy families were accustomed to arm
galleys; and the Sauli had negociated for the purchase
of these same triremes, intending to use them in their
maritime enterprises.</p>

<p>The behaviour of Fieschi contributed still more to
remove from the minds of Gianettino and the prince
every shadow of suspicion. He frequently visited
Andrea and congratulated him that, though more than
eighty years of age, he enjoyed vigorous health; and
he was so affectionate and obsequious to Gianettino
that the young admiral tried to obtain for him a suitable
rank in the imperial army. It should not be forgotten,
however, that one motive of Gianettino was, to
remove Fieschi from Genoa, as the only one likely to
make an effective opposition in his personal ambition.
It is certain that from the time Vega declared Gianluigi
to be engaged in machinations against the empire,
Gianettino conspired to remove from his path the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
person who could be an obstacle to his own advancement.
He only awaited Andrea’s death to put off the
slight mask which he had hitherto worn; and in expectation
of that event he had entrusted to Captain
Lercaro the business of assassinating the count. This
was proved by letters of Gianettino which fell into the
hands of Fieschi, and were by him shown to many
persons; though the writers in the interest of the
empire asserted that these documents had been forged
by Gianluigi.</p>

<p>About this time a messenger in the confidence of
Cæsar brought word to the count that Andrea’s solicitations
on behalf of his nephew were about to be
successful, and that Gianettino would soon be invested
with absolute power, on the same conditions as those
by which Casimo II. had ten years before been raised
to the government of Florence. This report, whether
true or false, was circulated among the friends of the
count, and doubly inflamed their resentment. They
resolved, in their indignation, not to procrastinate
longer the deliverance of the Republic, and to strike
down with one blow the ambitious youth who was
conspiring for supreme power.</p>

<p>The count’s first step was to recall from Civita-Vecchia
the fourth galley under the command of Giacobbe
Conte, on pretence of arming it as a privateer,
and sending it to cruise against the Barbary commerce
in the east. He had two other ships ready to sail in
neighbouring ports. With these vessels he was able
without exciting suspicion, to bring into the city the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
troops concealed in his castles. He placed some of
them on board his triremes; others were concealed in
his own house and those of his fellow-conspirators.</p>

<p>Verrina was the soul of every movement. He knew
all the arts of ingratiating himself with the plebeians,
and winning their sympathies to the cause of his
master. He began to allude in guarded phrases to the
necessity of a revolution in the interest of popular
government; and at the same time contrived to have
many vassals of the count enrolled in the permanent
militia of the Republic. Many artisans and mechanics
to whom he gave presents, promised him the service of
their arms to rescue by force a castle of the count
from some Florentine merchants, who, he said, had
seized it for debts. He was a man capable of inventing
traps and lures for all sorts of birds, and he enrolled
no one, whom he believed fitted for the work of the
conspiracy, until he had sounded the note best
adapted to charm his recruit.</p>

<p>Calcagno, though he had dissuaded the count from
drawing the sword, was so overcome by his love for his
young master, that he was the most ardent worker in
the conspiracy. He was assigned the office of providing
arms and provisions for the troops gradually being
collected and introduced into the city. Sacco was
appointed to maintain order and discipline among these
soldiers. Ottobuono, brother of Gianluigi, was sent to
the court of France to secure the sympathy of the
French monarch for the cause of the approaching revolution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>The Republic was at this moment without a Doge,
Giovanni Battista di Fornari having retired from the
magistracy. The galleys were idle and without crews,
because the season was unpropitious for navigation.
There were few of the permanent militia in the city,
and these for the most part were devoted to Gianluigi.
Giulio Cybo and other marquises of Valdimagra, had a
considerable force ready to break into the city at the
first opportune moment. The plebeians were ripe for
revolution; the Dorias and nobility without the least
suspicion. All things seemed propitious.</p>

<p>Such was the condition of Genoa on the eve of the
conspiracy. “Strange,” says Cardinal de Retz, “ten
thousand persons in Italy were awaiting the outbreak
of the insurrection, and there was not one to betray
the plot.”<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>We ought not, in my judgment, to decide upon the
merits of this conspiracy according to the views of our
own time, in which political movements are discussed
on principles of justice, but rather to give the conspirators
the benefit of the opinions and politics of their own
age. The doctrines of Macchiavelli, on which Gianluigi
had formed his principles, aim at the immediate
interests of states and derive principles from facts.
The theory of Guicciardini is the same. Whoever
undertakes to philosophise on the political ideas of the
sixteenth century will find that State policy never professed
any higher creed than utility, and that those
who were ambitious of repute as statesmen were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
bound by a public moral sentiment to show the justice
of their methods for obtaining desirable ends. Whoever
had introduced on the scenes of state craft abstract
maxims of morality would have been hissed off as a
fool. The creed ran thus:&mdash;“Do you wish to free your
country? Caress the tyrant and then kill him. Your
dagger is sharper than the eyes of his satellites.
Audacity and courage are everything. He who falters
for an instant is undone. Every means is just which
leads to success.”</p>

<p>Gianluigi held these maxims and he could not lay
them aside without freeing himself from the age in
which he lived. It was natural, therefore, that with
his noble intention of destroying the empire of the
Dorias he should use every instrument which seemed
adapted to his purpose. His heart was bursting with
suppressed rage; but his serene look and urbane
manners proclaimed him a peaceable and loyal citizen.
His nerves were strung with the spirit of revenge, but
his frank countenance, affable speech and good humour
were those of a mild-mannered and unruffled gentleman.
Once only he broke out against his rival with
fierce invectives; but ever after he feigned content
and put to sleep his adversary’s vigilance while meditating
his blow. He knew no other paths to his
end than those pointed out by the state craft of his
time. Why should he awaken suspicion in the Dorias
when all his interests said, “Deceive them”? It
is folly to arm an enemy who is delivering himself
unarmed into your power. Such, we have said, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the political morality of the speculative minds of that
day.</p>

<p>In other respects Fieschi was counted virtuous and
honourable and uncorrupted in the bosom of a corrupt
society; so that it is very doubtful whether he had a
natural son named Paolo Emilio who was afterwards
a captain in the pay of France, of which fact we find
mention in some memoirs. Fame said of him that he
had never punished, even in the slightest manner, any
person in his service or vassalage.</p>

<p>He deceived the Dorias and betrayed them against
faith; but only for a political object. The high design
of overthrowing one who had attempted his assassination
and of liberating his country ought, if it cannot absolve
him, to moderate the condemnation of posterity.
Brutus, too, was a deceiver and he is reputed great.</p>

<p>Whatever be the ideas of those who read in the
nineteenth century, it is clear that the statesmen of
the sixteenth heartily approved of Fieschi’s work. He
was what these times made him. A stranger to the
spirit of the classic revolutions of the earlier part of
his century, to the ascetic revolts of Savonarola, to the
paralytic ardours of Soderini, he drank in with his
Guelph principles the dissimulation of Rome. An
Italian and a disciple of Macchiavelli, he wished to
liberate his country without the aid of foreign arms.</p>

<p>A more favourable time could not have been desired.
The outbreak of the conspiracy would terrify Charles
who was deep in the German wars; Fieschi would be
able to form close alliances with France, England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Denmark and Turkey; he would stir the languid pulses
of the Italians and unite together Rome, Venice,
Genoa, Parma and Ferrara; Lucca and Siena, yet free,
were ready to join the Italian confederacy; Naples and
Milan would raise their heads.</p>

<p>Three centuries more of abject servitude were reserved
for Italy.</p>

<p class="pch">THE SUPPER IN VIALATA.</p>

<p class="pcs">Bloody propositions attributed to Verrina&mdash;The count repulses all
treacherous plans&mdash;New schemes&mdash;The conspirators introduced
into the city&mdash;Gianluigi pays his respects to Prince Doria&mdash;Gianettino
removes the suspicions of Giocante and Doria&mdash;The
supper of Gianluigi&mdash;The guests embrace the conspiracy&mdash;Eleonora
Cybo and her presentiments.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Everything</span> being now in readiness, the count called
together a few of his most trusted partisans to consult
upon the time and plan of their uprising.</p>

<p>About this time were celebrated the espousals of
Giulio Cybo, prince of Massa and Carrara and brother
of Eleonora Fieschi, with Peretta, the sister of Gianettino.
Verrina proposed that Gianluigi should give
a splendid banquet to the young couple which the
Dorias would be obliged to attend; and, that in the
midst of the festivities, assassins concealed for the
purpose should fall upon and butcher them. We find
that Verrina sent a messenger to Milan to make purchases
for the banquet and that with these purchases
he introduced into the palace some chests filled with
ammunition, swords, arquebuses, pikes and halberds.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
However, the count refused his assent to the proposition
as a violation of the laws of hospitality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>If we may believe Sigonio, Verrina formed another
not less inhuman project. An ecclesiastic of an
illustrious family was about to celebrate his first mass
in the church of St. Ambrogio, and the Dorias, Adamo
Centurione, his son Marco, Figuerroa and other old
nobles were expected to be present. Verrina proposed
to follow the example of the Pazzi in Florence and of
Olgiato in Milan and to assassinate them while kneeling
at the altar; then to rouse the city, take possession of
the senatorial palace, crown Fieschi with the diadem
of the Doges and put to the edge of the sword all who
offered resistance. But this atrocious design against
the liberties of the republic is denied by all the historians
of the period. Even the writers most partial to
the Dorias tell us that Gianluigi rejected the temptation
to assassinate Gianettino under the shadow of the
crucifix, though he was convinced that he could find
no better opportunity of crushing his rival at a single
blow.</p>

<p>The count abhorred bloodshed. In fact but little was
spilled in all the fierce civil commotions of Genoa.
These revolutions resemble wars of adventurers which
have no other aim than to capture the enemy. There
was no fighting to the death; he who refused to yield
the field or broke the lines of his enemy was proclaimed
conqueror without more ado. He who got possession
of the government palace seldom punished his adversaries
beyond confiscation of goods and banishment.
Our laws and our history are full of examples. Gianluigi
contemplated such a revolution and could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
bring himself to approve schemes of corruption and
slaughter.</p>

<p>Other propositions were then made. Among these
the most prominent was that of awaiting the period
for electing a new Doge, that is the fourth of the
following January. The entire nobility would then be
assembled in the government palace, and a single blow
would sever the knot. The plan seemed every way
feasible and Gianluigi was disposed to follow it; but
it was abandoned because it was found Gianettino
would be absent and escape the vengeance of Fieschi.
It was at length resolved to make a bolder attempt on
Christmas Eve, 1547 (old style.)</p>

<p>Orders were therefore issued on this plan to the
corporals in the city and to conspirators in other places,
particularly to Gianluca Fieschi, Giulio Cybo and the
marquis of Valdimagra. A number of armed men
were introduced into the city under cover of the festivities
of that day on which the burghers are wont to
flock into the city from every direction. Much artifice
was employed in bringing in the troops. They entered
in small bodies and by different gates, some even by
subterranean passages which conducted to the palace of
the count. Some wore the habit of mountaineers,
others had various disguises. A number were loaded
with chains under pretence that they were criminals
condemned to serve on the galleys of the count. Some
were lodged in the houses of the conspirators, but the
greater part in the palace in Vialata and neighbouring
houses. Still, the main body of the soldiers was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
brought within the walls, but distributed over mount
Fasce and contiguous heights, ready to enter the gates
so soon as a smoke should rise from the hill of Carignano.
Such was the good order and discretion of the
conspirators that the Senate had not the faintest
suspicion.</p>

<p>Early in the day count Fieschi, mounted upon a
spirited jennet, rode through the populous streets. He
had never appeared so jovial and composed, his strong
will governing his impetuous nature.</p>

<p>We find in some letters of Sacco,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of which we shall
speak in another place, that a personage whose
name is concealed held a conference that day with
the count in the palace of Vialata. This person discoursed
of the popular dislike for the Doria government,
and concluded by saying that the count had
only to wish it to become master of Genoa. It is
easy to see, that the count brusquely repulsed the
insinuation. Sacco believed that this man had been
sent by Gianettino to pry into the plans and purposes
of Fieschi; but it is now certain that the Dorias were
living in entire ignorance of the tempest gathering over
their heads. The unknown personage must have been
one of the spies whom Figuerroa kept on the trail of
all the opponents of the Spanish power in Italy.</p>

<p>Near the close of the day the count visited several
families. He went to the Doria palace, where, finding
in the vestibule the children of Gianettino with their
father, he caressed and kissed them with much tenderness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
After some conversation he drew Gianettino
aside and begged him to make no opposition to the
departure of some of his vessels which were that night
to sail for the Levant. He added that if the vessels
should discharge some fire-arms in the port, he hoped
the admiral would give himself no concern. He also
requested Gianettino to interpose his good offices with
prince Doria in case the prince should oppose the
count’s plan of privateering. This plan was in fact a
violation of the treaty between the emperor and the
Turks, because the galleys of Fieschi would have sailed
from a port over which Doria was, as the admiral of
Cæsar, master and guardian. Gianettino, not from
any love he bore the count, as a modern writer remarks,
but because the favour was of trivial importance, promised
to use his influence with the prince if it should
become necessary, and gave to his captains the order
requested by Fieschi.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Gianluigi went to the apartment of
Andrea who was lying in bed suffering from pains and
a fever. It happened that the prince was at that
moment in conversation with Gomez Suarez Figuerroa,
who, having received repeated messages from Gonzaga
respecting the conspiracies of Fieschi, had come to
speak of the soldiers taken by the count from the duke
of Piacenza and other facts wearing an ambitious
appearance. But so soon as Andrea saw the count on
his threshold, at the sight of the ingenuous and
courteous youth whom he loved almost as a son, he
bent his head to the ear of the minister and whispered,&mdash;“Tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
me yourself if it be possible that a base spirit
can be concealed under that angelic countenance.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>After a brief conversation the count retired, mounted
his superb jennet and rode gracefully along the streets.
Figuerroa exhausted all his arts to remove the delusion
of Doria but without success.</p>

<p>Shortly after, Andrea was on the verge of making
the discovery by other means, but in this case, by
combinations of chance, Gianettino was the person to
dissipate his apprehensions. Giocante, of the Casa
Bianca family, who had once been in the service
of the Venitians, had command of the permanent
militia.</p>

<p>He had distinguished himself in many actions and
especially when fighting with Doria at the head of a
large body of Ligurians in favour of France against the
Bourbons, he raised the siege of Marseilles. Colonel
Giocante had received on this very day several messages
informing him that many soldiers of various detachments
had left their quarters and taken refuge in the
house of Fieschi. Doria being in fact, though not
nominally, the head of the republic, Giocante informed
him and Adamo Centurione of what had occurred.
As soon as he had read the letter, Andrea called
Gianettino and ordered him to provide for the emergency;
but Gianettino related the conversation he had
just held with the count and reasoned that the momentary
desertion of a few soldiers, who were probably
vassals of the Fieschi and wished to celebrate the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in Vialata, was of no importance. He concluded by
saying that Giocante attached consequence to frivolous
matters, and so entirely removed the suspicions of the
prince.</p>

<p>The restless Verrina was not idle. At nightfall he
collected, in the house of Tomaso Assereto, more than
thirty gentlemen whose families had but recently been
inscribed in the book of gold. Fieschi, after leaving
Doria went directly to this place and invited these new
noblemen to sup with him that night in Carignano.
Arriving there many were surprised to find, in place
of festive preparations, the halls filled with arms and
armed men, strange faces and the din of warlike preparation.
They looked round for the count, but he
had gone to confer with Verrina and to learn whether
he had visited all the stations and the mustering places
of the conspirators, whether the Senate entertained any
suspicions or his near neighbours the Sauli had obtained
any information of the conspiracy. Verrina assured
him that all was prepared and that none of their adversaries
suspected their preparations for revolution, and
the count joined his guests.</p>

<p>These gentlemen, alarmed at finding the palace a
camp rather than a festive hall, gathered about him to
learn the cause of these extraordinary sights and
sounds. Then the count changing his careless look
into one of stern purpose and striking the naked table
with his fist, broke out,&mdash;“The time so longed for by
us, young friends, has at last arrived. Our native land
is to-night in our hands to be liberated from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
tyranny of the few and restored to a popular government.
This is my banquet, these are the festivals to
which I have invited you. You will never be invited
to a more honourable feast. With the approbation of
Cæsar, (and if you wish I will show you the proofs
and letters.) Gianettino Doria grown to excessive
power and riches has long aspired to tyranny in Genoa.
But finding me an obstacle to his designs, because I
am not less devoted to the public good and the liberties
of the nation than were my ancestors, he employs himself
day and night in conspiring against my life. He
has often vainly tried poison; now he trusts to the
secret dagger. Who of you does not swell with indignation
at the insolence of the old nobility, who both
in their private life and in the public offices deprive
you of honour and hold you in derision? I tell you
that more bitter and shameful things are reserved for
us. If we suffer so much to-day, what shall we have
when the patricians, with Gianettino at their head,
shall have drawn to themselves all public authority
and reduced us to vassalage? You will become a
plebeian herd! Let us then grapple like heroes with
evils which overhang me, yourselves and the country.
It is my design to kill the ambitious tyrant and Doria
himself, to capture their galleys, to occupy the government
palace and by destroying a few powerful enemies
to restore popular liberty.</p>

<p>“Even though the result of this enterprise were
doubtful, I have such confidence in your courage and
patriotism, that I believe you would not leave me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
encounter the danger alone. But the city is now in
our power. Three hundred of my bravest men are
with me, the greater part of the soldiers who guard the
government palace are my partisans. The keepers of
the gates are for us and await a preconcerted signal.
A galley rides at anchor in the port armed with a body
of men unsurpassed for equipment, strength and
courage. One thousand and five hundred artisans are
in arms to follow me. Two thousand men from my
castles are at the gates. As many more from Piacenza
will follow them. We have no enemy before us. The
night is serene and everything is propitious. You will
not be companions in the battle but spectators of a
victory. Give your love to your country; raise your
courage, your confidence. The glory and honour of
this undertaking are not only yours to share but yours
to dispense.”</p>

<p>We have preferred to translate from the Latin of
Bonfadio<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> this speech of the count rather than to
compose one in the style of rhetoricians. Bonfadio,
who was a witness of that revolt, thus clearly displays
the object of Fieschi to overthrow Gianettino who
aimed to master the republic and to build again the
popular government. Still, we are not able to agree
with Bonfadio that the count intended to assassinate
Andrea; because what we have written tends to prove
the contrary, and still more because the murder of the
old and decrepit prince would have provoked universal
condemnation, and finally because the means of escape<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
were left open to him. It was doubtless for the interests
of Bonfadio to receive this fable and incorporate it
in his history, to justify Doria’s sanguinary vengeance.</p>

<p>The words of Gianluigi powerfully moved his guests.
They enthusiastically offered to share the perils of the
enterprise. Two, Giovanni Battista Cattaneo-Bava and
Giovanni Battista Giustiniano, alone refused to take
arms; not because they dissented from the views of
Fieschi, but because they trembled at the sight of
muskets and sabres. Some of their companions drew
their daggers and wished to assassinate the cowards on
the spot; but Gianluigi interposed and contented
himself with confining them under guard to prevent
their revealing the conspiracy. This is a new proof of
the count’s unwillingness to shed blood.</p>

<p>Fieschi then placed, one by one, under the eyes of his
companions the letters of Pierluigi, of cardinal Farnese
and of others, which clearly showed that Gianettino
aspired to royal state and, as if already mounted to a
throne, was planning the death of the count. A cry
of indignation burst from the whole company and all
swore to liberate the country and the count from the
plots of the common enemy.</p>

<p>Fieschi then visited his wife whom he found immersed
in the most profound sorrow. The military
preparation, the clang of arms and the crowd filling
the palace had too clearly revealed to her that a bloody
enterprise was on foot. He tried to console her, told
her for the first time the long history of his conspiracy
and assured her that no danger lay before him. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
Eleonora strove to change his audacious purpose. She
kissed him, she hung upon his neck and exhausted her
affectionate acts to bend his resolute will. Pansa
entered at that moment and he, too, tried to divert
him from the undertaking; but with no better success
than the countess Eleonora. Fieschi embraced his
beloved spouse whose tears moved his heart to profound
pity; but his preparations were made, and if he had
wished it there was no place for retreat. When the
stern voice of Verrina called him from her arms, the
tears disappeared in an instant from his eye-lashes;
the husband vanished and only the conspirator remained.
Eleonora fell lifeless into the arms of Pansa.</p>

<p>The count returned to the hall, ordered a frugal
meal and then distributed the arquebuses, pikes, spears,
swords and coats of mail. There was a story that at
that moment the soot of the chimney caught fire and
that the cries of the countess filled the heart of the
count with painful forebodings. There were other
fables; that a flock of birds rising from the garden
below flew off to the left, that during the day his horse
stumbled and nearly threw him from his saddle, that a
dog bayed long and mournfully, that setting his foot
carelessly on the threshold of his palace as he went out
he nearly fell down. They tell us that Calcagno, who
was at his side at this moment, said to him that
according to the ancients sinister presages usually foretold
success, and then the count recovered his spirits
and drawing his sword said:&mdash;“Let us go,” leading
the way to the street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus far we have in these fables only the mania for
classic imitation which bewildered the historians of
Gianluigi, and led them to underrate his courage.
Now come the calumnies. We are told that the count
ordered that whosoever moved from the ranks or
hesitated should be run through; that being asked on
the way by a noble, who wished to save some friend,
whether all the nobility were to be butchered, he
answered that all should be slain beginning from his
own nearest relatives. It is clear that these romancers
destroyed all confidence in their veracity by such
exaggeration.</p>

<p>To disprove their partial statements it is only necessary
to say that Gianluigi himself had prevented the
assassination of the two nobles who had refused to follow
him. He forbade an attack on the palace of
Prince Doria, and would not even consent that Sebastiano
Lercaro should be killed, though he knew that
this person had accepted the commission of Gianettino
to assassinate himself.</p>

<p>Having drawn up his ranks and exhorted the men
to prefer a glorious death to preserving their lives by
cowardice, he sent off one hundred and fifty infantry
to occupy the Borgo de’ Lanieiri, and marched down
the descent of San Leonardo followed by the gentlemen
and by the select part of his troops. The hour was
about midnight.</p>

<p class="pch">THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND OF JANUARY.</p>

and of San Tommaso&mdash;Death of Gianettino Doria&mdash;Fieschi did

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Halting</span> for a moment at the foot of the hill, near
the ancient houses of the Frangipani, the count sent
his brother Cornelio to capture and hold the gate of
the Archi in order to secure a way of retreat to his
castles in case the enterprise should fail. He directed
his brothers Ottobuono and Gerolamo, who had just
returned from the court of France, to hold themselves
and their men in readiness to attack the gate of San
Tommaso at a preconcerted signal. The capture of
that strong place being an affair of moment, Calcagno
was ordered to support the attacking party with the
main body of the troops. These were the movements
in the city. As for the harbour, Verrina had orders to
work his galley outside of the Mandraccio and up to
the gates of the arsenal, thus laying siege to the ships
of Doria. Then Tommaso Assereto, who, as an officer
under Andrea, had the countersigns, was to enter the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
arsenal, by fraud or force, on the land side. The great
stress of the enterprise lay in taking these ships of
Doria, because they constituted the emperor’s naval
force and were able to command the Mediterranean.
Therefore, to make sure work at this point, the count
sent orders to Scipione Borgognino, one of his vassals
and a brave soldier, to embark the flower of the troops
upon some floats which had been prepared and to storm
the arsenal on the sea side, and having gained the
inside to open the gates unless Assereto had already
forced them.</p>

<p>The count reserved to himself no particular command,
but was at liberty to fly to the point of greatest
need. He entered the city through the gates of St.
Andrea, passed down the streets of Prione and San
Donato, gained the piazza of Salvaghi and advancing
to the bridge of Cattanei, now destroyed, waited near
Marinella until Verrina should inform him with a
discharge from a bombard that the attack on the arsenal
was began.</p>

<p>He intended, having occupied the arsenal and mounted
crews on the galleys of Doria, to unite the various
corps distributed through the city and move to the
assault of the Doge’s palace, the taking of which would
crown the enterprise with complete success. He employed
a subtle artifice to secure the death of Gianettino.
It was reasonably apprehended that the young
admiral, awakened by the din which would necessarily
be made in the harbour and arsenal, would take refuge
in a galley which always rode at anchor under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
prince’s palace. To exclude this mode of flight, a large
number of floats heavily laden were placed, some days
before, in front of this ship so as to render it impossible
to move her. Finally, it was agreed and ordered that
the cry used to arouse the plebeians and win their
stout arms to the cause of Fieschi should be:&mdash;“<i>The
people and liberty</i>.”</p>

<p>This was the general plan of insurrection. At first
every movement was successful. Cornelio occupied
the gate of the Archi with but little bloodshed; but
the fortress of San Tommaso proved a serious obstacle
to the conspirators. Captain Sebastiano Lercaro and
his brother were in command there. Both had the
reputation of being valiant soldiers, and they were
thoroughly devoted to the Dorias to whom they owed
their rank in the permanent militia. As soon as they
saw a large body of men moving against them and
heard the air ring with the name of Fieschi, they prepared
for a vigorous defence.</p>

<p>Captain Lercaro, who, according to rumour, had
accepted a commission to assassinate Fieschi, knew
well that his own life and that of his masters’ depended
upon a successful resistance, and he exerted himself
with such spirit and prowess that he several times
repulsed the assailants with serious loss. But Gerolamo
and Ottobuono returned to the assault with undiminished
courage, and Calcagno came to their succour with
reinforcements. The conflict now became too unequal.
Many of the soldiers of the government were killed
and wounded, others threw down their arms, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
some turned their swords against those of their companions
who still faced the enemy.</p>

<p>Lercaro, seeing himself well-nigh abandoned and his
brother stretched at his feet by a blow from a halberd,
surrendered to the Fieschi. Manfredo Centurione,
Vincenzo Promontorio, Vaccari and some other officers
and soldiers followed his example.</p>

<p>The palace of Prince Andrea stood within a stone’s
throw of the gate of San Tommaso which the Fieschi
had now occupied. Gianettino, awakened by the din
of arms and fearing that there was a mutiny on his
galleys, determined to go immediately to the arsenal.
His consort in vain urged him with tears not to set
foot outside the palace, as though she too had sad
presage of her destiny. In vain Andrea united his
prayers to those of his wife. “This, said the prince, is
not a mutiny or quarrel among our crews. It is the
roar of battle.” A relentless destiny drew the young
admiral on to his fate. Still believing that it was
some disturbance among his own crews, he set forth
for San Tommaso to obtain troops to quell the disorder.
He had only a page as an escort. The flicker of his
own lamp revealed him to his enemies, and rejoicing
at their good fortune they permitted him to approach
and fall into their net. Arriving at the walls, he
demanded in his usual imperious tone that the door be
opened. At that moment, pierced by many pikes, he
fell in a pool of his own blood. It is now known that
the first and fatal blow was dealt by Agostino Bigelotti
da Barga, a soldier of the government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>Gerolamo Fieschi now began to fortify his position.
Gianettino, the expected tyrant of Genoa, being dead,
it was no longer desirable to assail the Doria palace.
The decrepit Andrea was not obnoxious to their rage.
He was in error or spoke falsely who wrote that Fieschi
desired the death of Prince Doria that he might
plunder the splendid carvings, sculptures and furniture
of the Doria palace. The government itself by the
mouth of the lawyers of Padua, affirmed that Fieschi
did not wish to assault that house or to vent his wrath
against the prince, towards whom he felt no personal
grudge. This is the most splendid testimony that
Gianluigi did not aspire to power but to liberate the
Republic. And if those who undertook to transmit to
posterity the memory of these events had studied the
official documents, they could not have distorted
history by such grave errors. It is noteworthy, too,
that the name of France was not uttered on that fatal
night.</p>

<p>Count Gerolamo left his brother Ottobuono to guard
the gates and marched through the principal streets to
arouse the people for the national cause. The word
liberty, rung in the ears of people but yesterday despoiled
of rights which they had enjoyed for centuries,
produced a marvellous effect in the deep midnight
silence. New crowds crying, “<i>Gatto and liberty</i>”
gathered around the Fieschi standard. The very
women who, when the first uproar called their husbands
and brothers into the streets, clung to them with tears,
when they heard the name of Fieschi hushed their sobs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and uttered cries of joy. Such was the power of that
name. The night was now dark; the confusion and
the terror became indescribable. The shouts of the
populace and the blare of the trumpets filled the old
nobles with mortal dismay, and closing their massive
doors they did not venture to set foot in the streets.</p>

<p>Suarez Figuerroa, the minister of Cæsar, who had
foreseen the conspiracy, though he had not believed
the outbreak so near, was seized with a mortal fright,
and wandered half insane through the streets in search
of a way of escape from the city. Paolo Lasagna
encountered him and dissipated his personal fears by
assuring him that however the conflict might end, the
character which the minister of Cæsar bore would
perfectly protect him from harm, and conducted him
to the ducal palace. Lasagna, though he was not
opposed, being a new noble, to the movement on foot,
yet being a follower of the Adorni party, he thought
the occasion propitious for the restoration of his friends
to power. Therefore collecting some of his political
sympathisers, he conferred with them, and they decided
to wait until the balance should incline in favour of
one or other of the contending parties. If the attempt
of the Fieschi should be crushed, they would do nothing.
But if it should triumph, then they would unite with
the Spinola party and rouse the city with the cry of
Barnaba Adorno. For the present, they would watch
the course of the storm and see whom it destroyed.</p>

<p>As we have said, the Ducal office was at that time
vacant, and Nicolò Franco was administering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
government. Besides Lasagna and Figuerroa, there
were collected about him in the palace Cardinal
Gerolamo Doria and Prince Adamo Centurione who
had taken refuge there at the first sounds of revolution.
On receiving intelligence of the assault on the gate of
San Tommaso, they sent to reinforce it Bonifacio
Lomellini, Cristoforo Pallavicini and Antonio Calvi
with fifty men of the Ducal guard. The reinforcement
had hardly reached the street Fossatello when it was
surrounded and badly handled. The survivors with
difficulty gained the Centurione palace and took shelter
there. Francesco Grimaldi, Domenico Doria and some
other nobles had taken refuge in this palace. They
reproached the fugitive soldiers with their cowardice
and offered to lead them against the enemy. Though
but few in number they advanced boldly against the
revolutionists at San Tommaso; but Calcagno made a
vigorous sortie and routed them, killing some and
capturing others.</p>

<p>The count’s enterprise was moving with full sails.
Tommaso Assereto, who was appointed to carry the
arsenal by a <i>coup de main</i>, arrived at the door and
giving the countersign was about to enter without
bloodshed, when his enthusiastic men sprang from
under cover to enter with him and the garrison rushing
to arms repulsed them with serious loss. The first
attempt having failed, they went to the count who was
awaiting the result of the attack in the street of Maruffi
near the piazza San Pancrazio. He was fretting
wrathfully because his ears had not yet been saluted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
by the bombard as arranged with Verrina. At the
news of the repulse, he broke into imprecations upon
their cowardice, and ordered Scipione Borgognino to
embark at once on the floats and attack the arsenal by
sea, while he in person led the attack by land. To
assail a strong fortress with boats is a very perilous
undertaking and it would not have been attempted
but for the fierce ardour of Borgognino who, though
not seconded by the galley of Verrina, determined to
risk the assault.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the galley of Verrina was stationed
in that part of the port which is called the Mandraccio,
and when he attempted to work her towards the
arsenal, she struck full on a sand bank under water,
and held so firmly that their utmost efforts could
not get her afloat. This was the cause of Verrina’s
unexpected delay. At length, however, by superhuman
exertion and enthusiasm they succeeded in lifting her
off the bar and, with three other frigates, which had
that same night arrived in port (as we read in the
report of the Republic to Ceva Doria) moved forward
to the assistance of Borgognino. The latter had overcome
every resistance and driven the defenders from
every defensible part of the works, and the count,
hearing the roar of the battle within, assailed the gates
at the moment Borgognino, beating down all opposition,
rushed into the arsenal and ran to open it to his
leader.</p>

<p>A more complete success could not have been hoped
for by the conspirators. Of all their attacks that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
Assereto only had failed, and that chiefly because the
disaster of the galley had prevented a simultaneous
assault by sea and land.</p>

<p>The night was dismal; the sea stormy; the cries of
the Doria slaves, the clanking of their chains and the
disorder of the assailants rendered the arsenal a scene
of indescribable confusion. The count, seeing the
necessity of preventing revolt among the galley slaves
who were breaking their chains, with his natural
audacity threw himself on board the galley in which
the greatest disorder reigned, manned it with his own
men and gave the command of it to some of his most
trusted followers. Order was soon restored and he
resolved to go into the city. He attempted to pass
from the <i>Capitana</i> to the <i>Padrona</i> which was moored
by the side of the former. But the shock of a float
suddenly striking against them drove the vessels apart
and the frail and imperfectly fastened bridge which
connected them fell, carrying him with it down into
the sea. With him fell the hopes of the revolutionists.
Though the count was an able swimmer, he could not
save himself on account of being encumbered with
arms, and in the darkness and confusion no aid was
rendered him.</p>

<p>This is the history of his death according to the
writers of the time, with the addition that the count
and Gianettino perished in the same moment. But as
the water in the arsenal was not deep and the count’s
strength and skill as a swimmer must have enabled
him to save himself in spite of his armour, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
inclined to adopt the opinion of Campanaceo that he
struck his temples against the bridge in falling and
either fell senseless into the waves, or was so weakened
by the blow as to be unable to make any exertion. In
fact, when the corpse was taken from the water the
head was found to have suffered a severe contusion.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Prince Doria seeing that Gianettino did
not return and hearing the cries and tumult among
the galleys, despatched messenger after messenger to
learn the occasion of the unwonted uproar. Captain
Luigi Giulia at length brought him word that the
Fieschi were in arms and the city ringing with their
name. The old admiral fumed with vexation that his
decrepitude forbade him to mingle in the fray. He
was induced by the tears of Princess Peretta and the
entreaties of his servants to send his wife into the
adjacent convent of the <i>Canonici Regolari di San
Teodoro</i> and the widow of Gianettino with her children
into the monastery of Gesu and Maria. Then mounting
on horseback, escorted by Giulia, Count Filippino and
four servants, he rode to Sestri whence he went upon
a small oared bark to Voltri, and thence sent information
of the revolution to the duke of Florence and
Gonzaga in Milan, who were the only zealous partisans
of the imperial cause in Italy. He was then placed in
a palanquin and carried to the castle of Masone, a feud
of Adamo Centurione, fifteen miles distant from Genoa
in the heights of the mountains. In this painful
journey, he read upon the faces of his attendants the
fate of Gianettino and wept bitter tears, over it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
his grief was partly soothed by the hope of immolating
the whole Fieschi family to his terrible vengeance.</p>

<p>The first part of this conspiracy thus ended in a
great misfortune; but it saved the Republic by Gianettino’s
death. There can be no doubt that, had he
survived he would have gratified his own lust of
dominion and fulfilled the wishes of Cæsar, who desired
to divide Italy into principalities subject to himself
and founded on the ruins of the republics averse to
his empire.</p>

<p>The body of Gianettino was buried in the subterranean
chapel of San Matteo which is now adorned with
the monument of Andrea, a beautiful work of Montorsoli.</p>

<p>A brief episode will be permitted us here on the
place in the harbour where Gianluigi was drowned.
It is necessary to confute the error of those who tell
us it occurred in the station of Mandraccio. The
mistake arose from the confusion of various arsenals
whose true position has been lost in the great changes
wrought by time. The first arsenal of which we shall
speak was nothing more than a small basin near the
piazza Molo, protected in 1276 by a strip of land
covered with heavy stones and palissades. Then
galleys were built there. At an earlier period ships
were constructed along the Borgo di Pre, then outside
the walls, particularly in front of the commandery of
St. John and near the basin of St. Limbania.</p>

<p>It is difficult to comprehend how the Genoese, without
any tolerable dockyards, were able in so short a
time to put to sea the memorable fleets which sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
for Palestine, and the two sent against Pisa in 1120
and 1126. The first Pisan expedition numbered eighty
galleys, four large ships, thirty-five gatti, twenty-eight
calabi and other small craft manned by twenty-two
thousand combatants; and the second counted eighty
triremes and forty-three boats. We have credible
testimony that the Genoese equipped, in seven years,
six hundred and twenty-seven triremes; and in 1295,
in less than a month, they put to sea two hundred
galleys and other ships of which one hundred and five
were entirely new, and embarked on them thirty-five
thousand warriors, eight thousand of whom were
dressed in silk and purple. The founder of the arsenal
of which we speak was a certain Oliverio a cistercense
monk of the Badia of St. Andrea in Sestri. He constructed
two roads on that strip of land, of which we
have made mention, leading down to the gate of the
Molo, where there was already a bridge of large stones
on which rose a light-house for the convenience of
mariners. In the same year, Marin Boccanegra raised
a high wall around the Borgo di Molo which was then
outside of the piazza of that name. This wall ran
from the church of Our Lady of Grace along the shore
to the tower of the light-house, then, turning, it passed
behind San Marco and in front of Bordigotto famous
in popular legends for its fountain of blood and here
Boccanegra excavated the little port which was called
Mandraccio. Here was moored the galley of Fieschi,
and the shallowness of the water rendered it difficult
to work her out into the harbour. We find in fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
that though the excavations of Boccanegra are described
as very deep, yet that there was not sufficient water in
any part of the Mandraccio to float heavy galleys.
Some years after the attempt of Fieschi, that is in
1575, that part of the port which lies between the
Ponte Cattanei and the little mole of Mandraccio then
called the <i>Goletta</i> was dried under the direction of the
Sicilian engineer Anastasio, and the rocks lying at the
bottom of it were broken up and excavated for the
distance of twenty palms.</p>

<p>To enlarge this arsenal and protect it from the fury
of the waves, Boccanegra commanded, in 1283 the
colossal structure of the Molo extending it one hundred
and fifteen cubits into the sea. On the opposite side
of the arsenal, rose the Ponte Cattanei, called by the
name of the family who built it, and there was a
passage by an easy stair to the Ponte di Mercanzia
which led to the Portofranco and the Custom House.
The latter occupied the ground floor of the bank of St.
George, a palace which was adorned in 1262 with some
marbles taken from the palace of the Venitians in
Constantinople. To the right of the bank stood, and
still stands, the Ponte Reale and next it those of
Spinola, Legna and Calvi. In the vicinity of this last,
the third arsenal was begun in the period of which
we write, and behind it a fourth was afterwards
constructed.</p>

<p>The third arsenal, situated between the church of S.
Fede and S. Antonio, was built in 1282 and ten
thousand marks of the booty taken in Pisa in 1215<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
were appropriated for its construction. It was afterwards
doubled in size and half of it was appropriated
to the wine trade and the collection of duties on the
same. The other part was used as a station for galleys.</p>

<p>Gianluigi on the night of the 2nd of January, passed
from the street of Maruffi by way of Sottoripa to that
part of the arsenal which was used for the trade in
wine, and the gate of that part was opened by his men.
From this gate he passed into the back part of the
arsenal, where the Doria galleys lay, and there he was
drowned and buried in the muddy bottom of the dock.
He could not have met his fate in the fourth arsenal,
which is the one existing in our day, because it was
then unoccupied. Though begun in 1457 the works
had fallen into ruin from the want of skill in the
builders, and, they were not reconstructed until 1596.</p>

<p>The news of Fieschi’s death was received by the
liberal spirits of Italy as a national misfortune. Matteo
Bandello a month after the event wrote:&mdash;“He was
a young man of great heart and excellent speech; his
literary studies and the instructions of the learned and
virtuous Paolo Panza had given him a maturity of
judgment wonderful for his years. There is no
learned man of Italy or France who had not commended
him for his rare virtues, his intellectual gifts
and the greatness of soul which led him though so
young to combine everything with admirable prudence
for freeing his country from the Spanish yoke.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Nor ought we to omit that opinion which, according
to the same author, was expressed by Catando<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
d’Arimini who lived on intimate terms with the count.
Catando said:&mdash;“In a conference held at Montebrano
by the Fregosi, you, my masters, justly commended
Gian Aloise Fieschi, for he truly deserved your praise.
But I think that the most of you honoured his memory
with your good opinion on the basis of the current
estimate of his great virtues and singular mental
accomplishments. But if you had known him as
familiarly as I, the day would be too short to express
your admiration. If I wished to recount to you all
his merits, it would be easy to begin but impossible to
finish my discourse. I shall omit then his birth which
opened for him the paths to honour, his boyhood which
impressed all the Genoese with boundless expectation
of his future, the prematurely ripened intelligence
which he used in winning the love of the people and
the good will of the nobility, so that the people adored
him and the nobles admired and esteemed him. I
forbear to enlarge on the repute which he had among
the peasants of the Eastern Riviera and in the mountains
towards Parma and Piacenza; on the fact that his
vassals never complained of the slightest injustice, and
that he was so liberal when they were in want that
they adored him as a Providence, and that his neighbours
had the highest respect for his wisdom. I pass
by his affection for his brothers whom he wished to be
honoured as himself, that he loved and aided his friends
with fraternal warmth and avenged injuries with a
prompt hand.” The orator concluded by saying that
the most distinguished proof of Fieschi’s greatness was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
that he attempted great enterprises. We shall not
dwell on the people’s grief over the death of Gianluigi.
It kept alive his memory in national songs and mariner’s
hymns, which are so full of patriotic fervour that
they deserve to be collected and preserved. To justify
this opinion, we give two stanzas of a popular song
preserved in a codex of Beriana the subject of which is
the death of the count, the sorrow felt by the Genoese
at his loss and their high estimate of his merits.</p>

<p class="pp6 p1">E se l’alto e magnanimo desìre</p>
<p class="pp4">La fallace fortuna fece vano,<br />

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">When</span> Verrina had secured possession of the arsenal he
landed and marched to meet the count; but, learning
that Gianluigi had entered the palace on the opposite
side, he halted his men and awaited the orders of his
master. He could find no trace of the count from the
moment he had gone on board the Capitana, and after
some delay he went to that vessel and finding her
bridge broken began to suspect what had happened.
His courage did not fail him. He immediately ordered
the waters to be searched all around the galley, and
having satisfied himself of the fate of his master would
not allow the body to be taken up lest the sight of it
should discourage his men. He left the arsenal in the
charge of Tommaso Assereto and marched into the
city, sending the diver who had found the body to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
report their great calamity to Gerolamo Fieschi. At
the same time he requested an interview with Gerolamo
in order to devise means to conduct their enterprise
without the inspiration of its master spirit.</p>

<p>Gerolamo Fieschi, though full of audacity had not a
hundreth part of his brother’s talents. Seeing that the
death of Gianluigi had invested him with the headship
of the family, he relied on the fidelity of his
vassals and fellow-conspirators, and resolved to prosecute
the revolution in his own name. But, overburdened
by grief and weighty thoughts, he suffered Verrina’s
messenger to depart without any adequate answer.
This neglect lost him the powerful support of Verrina’s
genius and threw the weight of the undertaking upon
himself, a youth with no training or talent for so great
an enterprise. He gathered about him a select body
of militia and marched towards the Ducal palace,
hoping to crown the conspiracy by a single blow.</p>

<p>As we have said some Senators were assembled in
this palace; and among them was the historian
Bonfadio in company with Giovanni Battista Grimaldi.</p>

<p>A consultation was held after the news of the failure
at San Tommaso, and it was determined to cease
offering armed resistance to the conspirators and to
endeavour to restore peace by friendly negotiations.
Some persons offered to be the bearers of a peaceful
message to the count; these were Gerolamo Fieschi
and Benedetto Fiesco-Canevari, both of the Savignone
branch of the family; but leaving the Ducal palace
they did not again return thither.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Cardinal Gerolamo Doria and senators G. B. Lercaro
and Bernardo Interiano-Castagna were then commissioned
to carry to the count a request in the name
of the Republic to desist from his violent proceedings
and make known the object of his movement. But
the commissioners having walked a short distance outside
of the chancel, seeing arms and crowds of people,
were terrified and turned back. At the moment, the
guard of the palace, not seeing the senators, fired on
the crowd wounding some persons and killing Francesco
Rizzo an honoured citizen. The senators regained the
hall, and a new deputation was appointed consisting
of Agostino Lomellini, Giovanni Imperiale-Baliano,
Ansaldo Giustiniani and Ambrogio Spinola, citizens of
the highest rank and reputation. This deputation
went in search of the count; but near the church of
San Siro, they found the streets thronged with insurgents,
and a combat occurred between the guard
acting as escort for the senators and the people. It
was a confused nocturnal battle and the soldiers were
repulsed and fell back with the deputation.</p>

<p>In that midnight skirmish, Lomellini, after barely
escaping death, was taken prisoner and conducted to
San Tommaso; but he had the good fortune to make
his escape during the same night. The brave Giustiniani
alone refused to yield or fly and demanded
permission to pass on, as a peace messenger, to the
quarters of Count Fieschi. He was led to the presence
of Gerolamo and inquired for the Count of Lavagna.
Gerolamo brusquely informed him that there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
longer any Count Fieschi but himself, and added that
until the Ducal palace was delivered to his forces it
would be a waste of words to make propositions. He
would talk of peace after the surrender of the government
into the hands of his partisans. With these
words, Giustiniani was dismissed and the troops ordered
to collect in the piazza of San Lorenzo and in front of
the adjacent palace.</p>

<p>Giustiniani, justly inferred from Gerolamo’s incautious
speech that the rumour of the death of Gianluigi
had good foundation, and that the conspiracy, having
lost its able leader, would be easily crushed under the
management of a young man without reputation or
the support of popular affection. He returned to the
palace in haste, informed the senator that Gianluigi
was dead, and encouraged them to a spirited resistance.</p>

<p>The government recovered its confidence, sent
heralds to proclaim with the sound of the trumpet the
death of Gianluigi and ordered the nobles to arm their
servants and dependents. These last orders were
unnecessary. So soon as the trumpeters announced
the fate of the great leader, the multitudes of plebeians
were seized with terror, the lines of the troops thinned
rapidly and the squares and streets began to be
deserted.</p>

<p>The artisans and mechanics, particularly, who were
not attached to Gerolamo by the memory of kindness
or by the affection of vassals had no longer a cause to
maintain and they retired in despair to their homes.
It was almost day break. The best and most liberty-loving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
citizens felt that the enterprise had fallen into
the waves with Gianluigi, and fearing to be seen in
arms when the day dawned and thus to expose themselves
to the vengeance of the patricians, made haste
to abandon the field of victory. Many others who had
stood ready to throw themselves into the ranks of the
victors now sought the security of their own houses.
All seemed to accept the unhappy fate of Fieschi as
the judgment of God against the revolution. Uncertainty,
panic and fright filled all breasts. The
vassals of the count stood fast from loyalty to their
lord, and the soldiers who had deserted the standards
of the Republic were firm from desperation. A few
others heroic by nature, among them the strong armed
and stout hearted Gerolamo d’Urbino, did not tremble
or hesitate but resolved to meet every danger with
steadfast courage.</p>

<p>The government learned all these things by means
of messengers and spies who circulated among the
insurgents, and it was proposed to attack the forces
yet remaining under the standard of Gerolamo. However,
the more prudent part&mdash;taking account of the
limited number of their troops, the uncertainty of their
fidelity, the ferocity of the conspirators in whom
desperation would increase animosity and courage and
that much blood must be shed in such a contest&mdash;thought
it more wise to pursue a policy of compromise
and conciliation.</p>

<p>It happened that just then Paolo Panza appeared
before the senate to protest his entire innocence of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
part in the conspiracy which had been planned and
executed under his very eyes, and the fathers knowing
his temperate and conciliatory spirit appointed him
with Nicolò Doria as a commission to ask peace.</p>

<p>Panza was authorized to offer pardon to Gerolamo
and all the other conspirators and insurgents on condition
of their retiring from the city. The count was
at first irresolute. He had not pushed his attack at
once upon the palace and was now falling back and
fortifying himself at the gate of the Archi. The
authority of his preceptor finally prevailed over his
ambition and animosity, and he promised to withdraw
his men from the city. The act of pardon was written
and subscribed by Ambrogio Senarega chancellor of
the senate and ran as follow:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The illustrious Signoria and magnificent procurators
of the most serene Republic of Genoa, considering
that when sudden tumults occur in Republics
nothing more conduces to the preservation of the state
and the weal of the citizens than to destroy quickly
both the causes and the means of such disorders, which
grow more violent by being protracted; and Count Gio.
Ludovico Fieschi having during the past night, when
no one suspected his design, taken possession of two
of the city gates as means for carrying on an insurrection
against our authority; and this movement having
created a tumult in our midst and many citizens having
taken up arms in favour of the count to the great
detriment of public order; and an attack having been
made during this night upon the galleys of Prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
Doria and most of the said galleys having been seized
and disarmed and Signor Gianettino their captain
killed; for these and many other persuasive and conclusive
reasons believing it their duty to omit no means
for restoring tranquility, and that the best way of
making peace is to obtain possession of the gates without
further bloodshed and to remove the insurgents
outside the walls of the city; and being informed that
these ends may be gained by granting a general pardon:
Therefore in virtue of these our letters of grace, pardon
and remission, granted under due form of ballot, the
illustrious Signoria and magnificent procurators, supported
by the will of a great part of the citizens who
have come to this palace in the confusion of the night
in order to aid in preserving the Republic, do herewith
pardon free and absolve the said count Gerolamo
Fieschi and all his brothers, together with every other
citizen or inhabitant of this city or its jurisdiction and
every foreigner of whatever rank quality or condition,
for any and every crime, offence or license which they
have committed in the rebellion raised this night by
the said count, in taking the city gates, attacking the
galleys and whatever else they have said or done with or
without arms to give aid and comfort to this said plot,
conspiracy or insurrection. And we declare that in
whatever manner they may have been concerned in
this conspiracy and whatever crimes, including high
treason, they may have committed, none of them, either
collectively or singly, shall be liable to question or trial,
to confiscation of goods or personal harm. We intend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that this pardon shall be universal and embrace every
offence whatever, committed in executing the designs of
the said Count Fieschi and we grant herewith the most
complete pardon, remission and absolution.”</p>

<p>Count Gerolamo, trusting to the good faith of the
Republic, spent a brief hour in Carignano and then set
out with his followers for Montobbio, not wishing to
depart from Italy lest the Dorias should assail his
feuds. Ottobuono, Cornelio, Verrina, Sacco, Calcagno
and other leaders of the conspiracy took a more prudent
course and set sail on their galley for France. Mindful
that a government rarely or never pardons treason, they
removed themselves from its reach and took with them
the prisoners they had captured at San Tommaso.
When they arrived off the mouth of the Varo
they set the captives at liberty; among them were
Sebastiano Lercaro, Manfredi Centurione and Vincenzo
Vaccari. By releasing these prisoners they deprived
themselves of a guarranty which might have saved
their lives at a later period. These conspirators were
not the only persons who sailed from the port that
morning.</p>

<p>The convicts and Turkish captives on board the
Doria galleys had broken their chains and they resolved
to avail themselves of the universal confusion to make
their escape. The ships of Prince Doria, Antonio Doria
and some other private persons were lying dismantled
in the harbour. In the fury of the tumult the galleys
of Andrea were plundered by the plebeians and by the
slaves, and the latter collected with their booty on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
board the Capitana which had escaped the fury of the
sack. There was a good reason for this exception.</p>

<p>This galley, formerly called the Temperanza, had
been a Venitian vessel and the men of Barbary had
captured her and four other triremes in 1539, near
Corfu in the waters of Paxo, taking prisoner at the
same time the Commandant Francesco Gritti.</p>

<p>Dragut Rais was so pleased with the sailing qualities
and rich equipment of the Capitana that he made her
his flag-ship. Gianettino Doria captured her in the
engagement in which the corsair himself fell into our
hands. On the night of the second of January the
African prisoners to the number of three hundred or
more threw themselves on board this galley, as a piece
of their own property, and sailed out to sea. Though
two galleons of Bernardino Mendozza, which were
anchored in another part of the harbour and so escaped
the pillage, were sent in chase at early dawn, the
fugitives made good their flight and after a long voyage
arrived safely in Algiers.</p>

<p>The Doria fleet suffered grave damages in that night
pillage, the furniture and rigging being reduced to a
mass of ruins. These disorders originated with the
liberated slaves, and the bad example was followed by
the convicts who afterwards carried confusion and
alarm into the city. Many of the lowest class of the
people penetrated into the foundries and shipyards of
Doria, and what they could not carry away they threw
into the sea. During the following days, the convicts
were hunted out in every quarter of the city and taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
back to their oars, and some of the equipments of the
ships were recovered by the zealous efforts of Adamo
Centurione whose pecuniary interests were united to
those of Doria.</p>

<p>It is worth while to observe that the storm of this
conspiracy broke over the ships of Andrea. The
government issued a proclamation that whoever should
have taken or should find anything belonging to the
galleys of the prince, as arquebuses, pikes, halberds,
visors, helmets, corselets, axes or any other arms or tool
belonging to these vessels, should within three days
consign them to the justices in the Riviera, or to the
agents of Doria in Genoa, or deposit them in the
churches of San Vito and Annunziata.</p>

<p>Our historians have neglected to describe one of the
galleys of Doria which was a wonderful specimen of
Genoese naval architecture. She was built by Doria
in 1539 for the personal use of Charles V. in his
expedition to Tunis, and surpassed all other galleys
by fifteen palms in length and four palms in breadth<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.
She bore three standards of crimson damask, each
twenty-three palms in length and beautifully embroidered
in gold. The one in the midst had in the
centre a star with golden rays and appropriate inscriptions;
that at the stern bore the figure of an angel and
the one on the prow a shield, a helmet and a sword.
Besides, there were three flags at the poop also of
damask and thirty palms in length, and another banner
of white damask was embroidered with chalices, pontifical
keys and red crosses, with fitting inscriptions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
There were two flags of red damask bearing the imperial
columns and the device&mdash;<i>plus ultra</i>&mdash;invented
by the Milanese Marliano, physician to Charles V. and
an excellent mathematician. The vessel also had
twenty-four other flags of yellow damask and appropriate
devices. The saloon was adorned with beautiful
arabesques in blue and gold, and the sides were
tapestried with cloth of gold and silver, hung so as to
represent pavillioned domes. The castle on the poop
was covered with exquisite carvings and there were two
carpets for the deck, one of scarlet cloth for daily use
and another, for state occasions, of crimson velvet and
brocade of gold. The crew wore satin jackets. The
gun carriages, rigging and other furniture were all in
the most perfect style and finish of the naval art of
that period. The slaves and convicts ruined all these
splendid equipments and furniture.</p>

<p>After this pillage, prisoners of war and other slaves
were treated with greater severity. For, though up to
this period the young men served at the oar, yet many
of the Mamalukes, as the Barbary prisoners were called
in Genoa, had some privileges from the government
and their servitude was not of a strict and painful
character. Some of them had the permission to engage
in minute traffic within the city and had their markets
in the piazza of the arsenal and the Piano of St.
Andrea. There they shaved and trimmed the beards of
the citizens, and none could equal them in this art.
They traded in coffee, sugar, brandy, pipes, tobacco
and game. They practised small frauds in their trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
and some of them grew rich, while many were able to
buy themselves out of bondage. These privileges were
now taken away from them, and were not restored
until many years after. In this way the rigours of
slavery were increased among us, though the system
was restricted to the “infidels” who were either bought
in Egypt or captured in war. It is true that a law of
the Republic forbade the buying and selling of slaves
in the land of the Sultan; but this provision was
evaded by shipping the captives to Caffa where the
Grand Turk sent agents for the traffic. Our statutes
by enacting grave penalties against slave-stealers, held
slaves to be the absolute property of their masters;
and in 1588 it was ruled that in a case of shipwreck
the loss should be distributed <i>pro rata</i> counting all
sorts of merchandise “including male and female
slaves, horses and other animals.”</p>

<p>The government hastened to inform the emperor
and Ferrante Gonzaga of the insurrection. The latter
sent Cavalier Cicogna on a mission to the senate and
he himself at the head of a strong force advanced to
Voghera to watch the movements of the Fieschi at
Montobbio. All the Italian princes friendly to the
empire congratulated the Republic on its escape from
the conspiracy. Cardinal Cibo, who sent as his
messenger Ercole de Bucchi, the Duke of Florence, by
his legate Jacopo de’ Medici, and the ten conservators
of liberty of Siena, by M. Nicodemo, offered their
services and assistance to the government in case of
need.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>We find also a letter of Giulio Cybo, Marquis of
Massa, in which he declares that he has collected troops
at Borghetto to march to the assistance of the
Republic; but it became known afterwards that these
troops had been massed to aid the Fieschi insurrection.
They did not pertain alone to the Marquis of Massa,
but also to Gasparo di Fosnuovo and other feudatories.
We shall presently speak of the congratulations
sent by the Pope and Pierluigi Farnese.</p>

<p>The government pledged itself to universal amnesty;
we shall now see how it kept faith. Encouraged by
the departure of the Fieschi, the senate despatched
Benedetto Centurione and Domenico Doria to escort
Andrea back to the city and to condole with him for
the loss of Gianettino. This last was a piece of
hypocrisy, for they secretly rejoiced over their deliverance
from the rising tyrant. Andrea returned on the
sixth of January and was received with regal pomp.
We learn from old documents that the wrathful old
man cloaked his vengeance under the mantle of patriotic
zeal, and, assembling the fathers on the very day
of his return, told them in well-rounded phrases
that the amnesty, having been granted under the
pressure of necessity and without the free choice of the
senate, ought not to be observed. It was, he said, of
bad example and precedent to treat with rebels; in a
free country the voice of pity and affection ought to
be unheeded and the rigour of the law steadfastly
administered. It was needful, to save the Republic
from the perils which still impended, to make terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
examples. The senate should make haste to prove to
Cæsar its zeal by punishing the outrages perpetrated
against ships under his flag; those only deserved
pardon whose participation in the conspiracy had been
forced or the effect of momentary passion. The Fieschi
as enemies of the emperor and rebels against the
Republic ought to be condemned to death and their
goods confiscated. In no other way could the senate
meet the wishes of Cæsar and prove their zeal for the
public safety.</p>

<p>Those who did not agree with these sentiments of
vengeance rather than justice did not dare to lift their
voices against the will of Doria. The senate referred
the question to a commission of jurists, who rather
than incur the enmity of Doria, devoted themselves to
find a justification for breach of faith and a decree of
blood. They reported:&mdash;“The act of pardon is not
binding because it was conceded in a rebellion with the
sword at the throat of the nation; and because it was
not granted in a regular session of the senate but by a
number of them casually met and having no power under
the laws to make decrees and issue amnesties.” They
further declared that Doria as the representative of Cæsar
could proceed against the rebels, because neither he
nor his master had given any promise of pardon.
This opinion was chiefly invented by Bernardo Ottobuono
who exhausted much subtle argument to
procure the condemnation of the Fieschi. His dialectic
and legal skill was at that time in great repute among
the partisans of Spain; now history stirs his forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
pleadings, only to put a note of infamy before his
name. The senate, having heard the complacent
judgment of its legal advisers, took up the filthy burden
and hastened to be rid of it by condemning the Fieschi.
It is a new proof that Prince Doria possessed an
absolute power over the Republic. But this solicitude
for vengeance has crowned his name with an eternal
reproach.</p>

<p>The act of pardon was revoked; the Fieschi and the
soldiers who had deserted the standards of the senate,
particularly Gerolamo d’Urbino, were declared guilty
of high treason. The decree of condemnation bore the
date of the 12th of February. We report it in full
because, though rather an act of wrath than of justice,
it serves to acquit Gianluigi of many crimes of which
he was afterwards accused.</p>

<p>“The illustrious Doge and magnificent Governors
and Procurators of the most serene Republic of Genoa.</p>

<p>“Every state is governed by two things which are
divine principles, reward and punishment, the first
encouraging the good to honest living and love of
country and the second withholding the bad from
treason and insurrection. If the reward of well-doing
be taken away the motives for patriotism cease to exist
and if criminals are not punished the ill-disposed
are encouraged to continuance in disobedience when
new occasions are presented them. Iterated crimes
are the most dangerous, since they always increase in
magnitude and peril, and small beginnings of treason
threaten the safety of Republics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the night before the third of January in this present
year, Gianluigi Fieschi having secretly assembled
armed men and concealed them in his house, corrupted
and enticed some soldiers in the pay of the Republic,
and with his brothers Gerolamo, Ottobuono and Cornelio
and other partners in his guilt, issued forth
armed, assailed and killed many of the guards, seized
the gates of the city and cruelly assassinated Gianettino,
lieutenant of Prince Doria, Captain General of
the emperor on the seas; then, uttering seditious cries,
they incited the people to take up arms against the
Republic, and induced some of them to break into the
arsenal where lay the unprotected galleys of the said
Prince Doria, the defender of Christianity, and to
pillage the said vessels and liberate their slaves and
convicts.</p>

<p>“Not content with these crimes, the conspirators
turned their arms against the commissioners of the
senate, and demanded that this Ducal palace should
be surrendered into their hands, threatening death to
such as should resist their will. Having been admonished
to lay down their arms and cease to disturb
the public peace, they refused to obey until they
obtained grace and pardon for themselves and their
accomplices, which condition the senate accepted,
believing it the most speedy remedy for the disorders
of the afflicted city, and the best means of saving
public liberty. The said conspirators then departed
from the city, not because of the pardon given by the
senate, but because Gianluigi Fieschi had perished in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the sea, many of their followers had deserted them and
the troops of the Republic had recovered one of the
gates of the city.</p>

<p>“These facts show the heinousness of the crime
attempted against the state and what weighty evils
were devised to its hurt, and furthermore that the
Republic is still in peril from the consequences of the
pardon extorted by force and without foundation in
justice, equity or religion. The authors of these acts
of treason must not escape the reward of their crimes.</p>

<p>“Therefore, we the illustrious Doge and magnificent
governors of the most serene Republic of Genoa, having
taken our vote in due form of law, do declare and
condemn as traitors, rebels and enemies of the state,
the late Gianluigi Fieschi and his brothers Gerolamo,
Ottobuono and Cornelio, and we banish them perpetually
from the dominions of Genoa and confiscate
all their property for the use of the state. We further
order that the Fieschi palace in Vialata be razed to the
ground and we give authority to the rectors of the
city to destroy also all other houses belonging to the
Fieschi family, if they shall deem it of public utility.</p>

<p>“We further declare and condemn as public enemies
and traitors with the same penalties Raffaello Sacco of
Savona, doctor in law and auditor of the said Gianluigi
Fieschi, Vincenzo Calcagno, servant of Fieschi,
and Giacobo Conte, son of the late physician of that
name (who was an Hebrew) and captain of a galley of
the said Gianluigi. We decree also that the houses of
the said persons be reduced to ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>“We further declare and condemn as rebels and
enemies of the Republic Giovanni Battista De Franchi&mdash;Verrina,
Scipione dal Carretto of Savona, Domenico
Bacigalupo, Gerolamo Garaventa and Desiderio Cambialanza;
and we confiscate their goods and authorize
the illustrious rectors to destroy their houses if they
shall believe such destruction for the good of the
Republic.</p>

<p>“We also confiscate the goods of Battista son of the
late Pantaleo Imperiale-Baliano, Geronimo, son of the
late Vincenzo Usudimare, of Gerolamo De Magiolo son
of Martino, of Fiesco Botto and Lazzaro De Caprile, and
we banish each of them for fifty years. These persons
are ordered to depart forthwith from the city and the
territories of the Republic and to remain abroad under
peril of death.</p>

<p>“We also declare rebels and banish the undernamed
persons for the periods following their names, varying
according to the degree of their guilt: Francesco
Pinello of Gavi for eight years; Francesco Curlo,
Bernardo Celesia, Tommaso de Assereto called <i>Verze</i>,
Gerolamo Marrigliano, called <i>Garaventino</i> and Gerolamo
Fregoso, son of the late Antonio, for fifty years
each; Battista Giustiniano son of the late Baldassaro,
Paolo Geronimo Fieschi, Francesco Badaracchi and
Pantaleo Badaracchi called Tallone&mdash;brothers and
butchers in Suziglia, for ten years each; Gerolamo del
Fiesco son of the late Gio. Giorgio for ten years;
Francesco Marrigliano, son of the late Biaggio, barber
in Bisagno, and Andrea di Savignone for five years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
each; Nicolò of Valdetaro, Giovanni Battista Retiliaro
and Benedetto Botto for ten years each. All the said
persons will be required to leave the territories of the
Republic within fifteen days and to remain beyond the
frontiers for the periods assigned them severally under
peril of death.</p>

<p>“Whereas the laws of the Republic forbid citizens to
hold commerce with banished persons under heavy
penalties, to prevent any from incurring these penalties
through ignorance, we ordain that no citizen whatever
shall hold any intercourse or have any correspondence
by messengers or by letters with the said rebels and
exiles, particularly that no one shall go or send any
message to Montobbio under the penalties contained
in the laws. And let every citizen be wary of his
conduct, for they who shall be guilty will be severely
punished.”</p>

<p>Many have written that Scipione Fieschi was also
involved in the condemnation of his brothers; but the
documents above given prove the contrary. This
youth was hardly eighteen years of age and was
pursuing legal studies in Bologna according to the
custom of Genoese noblemen. We find in the list of
the doctors in law of 1390 the names of Doria, Spinola,
Salvago, Imperiali, Dinegro, Grilli and Montaldi, and,
as we have shown, the Fieschi were conspicuous in legal
learning. From a very early period they had studied
law in Bologna. The registers of illustrious pupils
from 1260 to 1300 contains the names of several
Fieschi who attended the lectures of the distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
jurists of that school, chief of whom was Jacopo d’
Albenga. About 1348, Emanuel Fieschi, in order to
facilitate the studies of his family in that city, founded
there a perpetual college, and endowed it with a
liberal income. His nephew Papiniano added largely
to the endowment.</p>

<p>When Scipione heard of the events of Genoa, he
removed to Valdetaro, and from this feud of his family
wrote to the senate, on the 17th of January, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>“When I heard of the insurrection in my native
city I was more dead than alive; and if the shedding
of my blood or giving my life could repair the misfortune,
your excellencies may be sure I would not
shrink from the sacrifice. I have an intense sorrow of
heart that one of my house should have attempted
revolution, and especially a revolt against the authority
of that prince who has always protected and benefited
our family and to whom I hope always to be a good
servant. Being most innocent in this conspiracy, I
pray your excellencies to receive and hold me as a
good son of the Republic. Such I am and hope always
to remain, ever willing to expose my life to any peril
for the public good. I pray you not to abandon me
as a member of my brother’s family, to have compassion
on my misfortune and not to permit that the fault of
another shall prejudice me or bring me evil. With a
heart disturbed and pained by these events beyond
my power to describe, I kiss your hands and recommend
myself to your clemency.”</p>

<p>We shall hereafter see how the senate was affected
by his pathetic appeal, and how it accepted him as
a son.</p>

<p>Doria, indefatigable in the pursuit of revenge,
instituted search for the corpse of Gianluigi. Few
believed he was dead, and Doria feared that he had
escaped into France and was preparing to let loose a
new tempest upon the government.</p>

<p>After four days of search, the corpse was found by
a diver named Pallino. Doria wished to vent his
wrath and awe the people by suspending the body
before the gates of the arsenal; but he did not dare to
run the risk of a new popular outbreak. The body
was therefore returned to its grave in the waves. Two
months after Doria caused it to be fished up again,
weighted with a mass of stones, carried out and
launched into the deep sea.</p>

<p>The vacancy in the office of Doge, created by the
resignation of Giovanni Battista di Fornari, was filled
by the election of Bendetto Gentile. Fearing that the
confederates of Fieschi might renew their insurrection
and that it might break out in the very hall of the
senate, the new Doge forbade the wearing of arms in
the Ducal palace. At the same time he sent Ceva
Doria as a legate to Cæsar in Germany (the brothers
Luca and Giovanni Battista Grimaldi were already at
that court for other business) to inform the emperor
fully of the perils from which Genoa had escaped and
to assure him of her constant devotion. Ceva Doria
had secret instructions to ask the consent of Cæsar to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the absorption of the Fieschi estates by the Republic.
The request particularly regarded Varese, Roccatagliata
and Montobbio, in the last of which Count Gerolamo
was fortified. Ceva Doria was instructed to manage
the matter with much dexterity. He was to represent
that Varese and Roccatagliata belonged by ancient
rights to the Republic and that Montobbio was a cause
of incessant irritation and frequent danger to the city;
that the Republic would be gratified if the emperor
should wish to honour and reward his faithful servant
Figueroa with some feud; that they had already
occupied Roccatagliata, Varese and Calice and that
Ferrante Gonzaga had protested, but that Domenico
Doria, the commissioner of the Republic, had satisfied
the imperial governor that the occupation was necessary
to protect these feuds from the Lords of Lando. Ceva
Doria was also instructed to devise a plan for securing
the imperial approval to the confiscation of the castles
of Torriglia and San Stefano.</p>

<p>When Prince Doria learned of these negotiations
with the emperor, not wishing that the rich estates of
his enemy should go into other hands than his own he
sent Francesco Grimaldi to the emperor to oppose the
wishes of the senate and to obtain the best of the
Fieschi feuds for himself. He did in the end obtain
the greater part of this property, as we shall hereafter
show. Antonio Doria also prayed the Spanish monarch
to permit him to occupy Santo Stefano, he having
bought the Malaspina claims upon the feud. Antonio
at the same time besought the senate to preserve strict<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
secrecy in this negotiation lest the prince should be
offended on hearing of the intrigue. Ceva Doria complained
strongly of this disagreement between the
envoy of the Republic and that of Andrea; particularly
that Grimaldi preserved a surly and reserved manner
and refused to communicate anything of importance to
his colleague.</p>

<p>The emperor sent Don Rodrigo Mendozza to the
senate to report his satisfaction at the escape of the
Republic from such grave perils. He also sent letters
to Andrea containing solemn assurances that he would
repair the losses sustained by the prince. At the same
time he ordered Don Ferrante Gonzaga to proceed to
the punishment of the Fieschi without a moment’s
delay. The crime for which the imperial governor was
required to proceed against them was that, being
vassals of the empire, they had assailed the emperor’s
galleys and admirals. Gonzaga wrote to the senate
and to Doria on the subject, but his proceedings did
not have any result because Andrea and the senate had
already decreed the utter extermination of the Fieschi.
Cæsar did not, however, content himself with this, and,
on the 27th of October, 1547, he proclaimed the Fieschi
as rebels and divested them of all their feuds, which
he gave to Andrea to be held for the children of
Gianettino. The cession included Montobbio, Varese,
Roccatagliata, Valdetaro, Pontremoli and Santo Stefano.
This first decree did not take full effect, because the
Republic had some of the castles in its power, especially
Pontremoli where the inhabitants had anticipated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
Gonzaga and surrendered to Gasparo Di Fornari who
occupied it for the Republic.</p>

<p>Doria was not content with obtaining the greater
part of the Fieschi feuds. He insisted upon the
destruction of the sumptuous palace in Vialata and it
was razed to the foundations. The work of demolition
was conducted with such angry haste that a great part
of the walls fell into the gardens of Ambrogio Gazella
and the Republic paid for the removal of the rubbish.
A slab of infamy was affixed to a wall near the ruins
bearing a decree that nothing should ever be built
upon the ground where a citizen had conspired against
his country. The inscription no longer exists. The
tables now in Vialata refer to rights of private property.
Merciful time has cancelled the records of infamy
against Gianluigi, though he has preserved them
against the names of Vacchero, Raggio, Della Torre
and Balbi.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> The stone (as we find in a decree of
1715) was torn down, not by order of the Doge but
by unknown hands, about 1712, perhaps by some of
Gianluigi’s relatives.</p>

<p>Ancient tradition tells us that the marbles of the
Fieschi palace were employed to embellish that of the
Spinola which was erected on the ruins of the tower
of the Luccoli. It is that edifice faced with alternate
black and white marbles which stands on the piazza
Fontane Morose. We know not whether the tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
be true, but it is certain that the statues in the palace
of Spinola pertain to the family of its owners. The
stones and marbles of Vialata were bought at auction
by one Antonio Roderio and were scattered. The
sculptures and other ornaments of the magnificent
fountain which adorned the garden shared the same
fate. They were the work of Giovanni Maria di Pasalo
who, not having been entirely paid for his work by
Fieschi, received some compensation from the Republic.
The government took possession of the furniture and
precious vessels which the palace contained not excepting
the silver service which according to a memoir of
Count Gianluigi Mario to the king of France (preserved
in Beriana) was valued at one hundred thousand
crowns.</p>

<p>Nothing remains of the splendid residence of the
counts but a narrow subterranean passage whose
architecture is of the fifteenth century. The walls
are brick and it is covered with slate. Time and damp
have nearly destroyed it. A branch of it once extended
to the sea where the battery of Cava was afterwards
erected, but not a vestige of this part now remains.
The principal passage led to the valley of Bisagno, outside
the gate of the Archi, and served for a means of
retreat from the city in times of revolution. It is
probable that this passage furnished Gianluigi with the
means of introducing into the city, a few days before
the insurrection, the armed men from his castles.</p>

<p>The imperial party were not content with the ruins
of the Fieschi palace, but wished to destroy all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
monuments of the family’s greatness. Two houses
fronting the cathedral were appropriated for the debts
of Fieschi and thus escaped ruin. The very churches
were not spared. The arms surmounted by a cardinal’s
hat which Lorenzo Fieschi had placed in Santo Stefano
in 1499 when Donato Benci, a Florentine sculptor and
architect, executed some works in that church, were
now removed. Throughout the Eastern Riviera, the
Doria faction glutted their vengeance upon the dwellings
and castles of the Fieschi. In Chiavari they
publicly tore down and threw into the sea an inscription
which attributed the foundation of the church
of St. Giovanni to Bardone Fieschi.</p>

<p>Nor were the Dorias alone in hastening the destruction
of the Fieschi palace. The Sauli whose quarrel
with the Fieschi we have mentioned, had seen with
envious eyes the erection of a palace in their neighbourhood
which outshone the splendour of their own, and
they were ambitious of being sole masters of the hill of
Carignano. There were other stimulants to vengeance.
Popular legends tell us (and we count legends more
valuable than the breath which scatters them) that the
Sauli family attended divine service in the church of
the Fieschi in Vialata. One day Bendinelli Sauli, in a
friendly manner asked the Fieschi to delay the service
a little in order that his people might be present. The
Fieschi responded:&mdash;“If you wish to hear mass at
your pleasure, build a church of your own.” Sauli
remembered the discourteous speech and, in 1481,
bequeathed two hundred and fifty shares in the bank of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
St. George to be left at interest for sixty years and then
expended in erecting a magnificent church and two
hospitals in Carignano.</p>

<p>The descendants of Bendinello, stimulated by old
and new antipathies, were gratified witnesses of the
destruction of the mansion of their rivals, and near it
they erected the church which commemorated the
bequest of their ancestor. As soon as the palace of
the Fieschi was destroyed, Galeazzo Alessi was called
to Genoa and in 1552 he commenced the church of
Carignano. The superb basilica cost the Sauli a
hundred thousand gold crowns. It would be a perfect
monument to their wealth and public spirit, if the front
were not disfigured by some statues of inferior workmanship.
They embellished their vengeance by a
beautiful christian charity which survives the antipathies
out of which it grew. Stefano Sauli, a descendant
of Bendinello, bequeathed another large legacy to
construct the massive bridge which conducts to the
church and unites the two hills.</p>

<p>But public and private wrath did not fully attain
their end. A beautiful picture of Gianluigi and
portraits of Verrina and Sacco escaped the vandalism
of their enemies. In the dark and narrow chapel of
the cathedral near the tomb of the Fieschi family, there
is a picture painted by Luca Cambiaso representing
the protectors of Genoa, St. John the Baptist, St.
Lawrence and St. George. In the face of the last saint
you have the features of Gianluigi, and tradition tell
us that the others are Sacco and Verrina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>It did not occur to Andrea Doria, when he was
destroying every trace of his rival, that the love of
friends would entrust the image of the dead to the holy
guardianship of the altar.</p>

<p class="pch">THE CASTLE OF MONTOBBIO.</p>

populace&mdash;The Republic is induced by Andrea Doria to assault

castle of Montobbio razed to the foundations.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> castle of Montobbio was a beautiful and strong
fortification, situated ten miles from Genoa, occupying
the brow of a mountain, and looking down on a deep
valley closed round with spurs of the Apennines. The
Beriana papers assert that it once belonged to an Obizzo
di Montobbio who sold it, in 1232, to Ansaldo Di
Mari. We find no record of the transfer to the
Fieschi family. The torrent of Scrivia on the south,
and the wooded heights encircling it on every side,
render the position naturally impregnable. The rough
crests afford no convenient positions for placing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
batteries so as to enfilade the redoubts or batter the
walls. In fact, it often held large armies in check.</p>

<p>Gianluigi had greatly increased its power of resistance
by employing in his works the science of
fortifications which was just then invented. The use
of bastions with angles dates from that period.
Giuliano da San Gallo employed them in the fortress
of Pisa and Andrea Bergauni at Nice. The count
repaired the curtains and the walls, increasing the
width to fifteen feet, sloped their sides and constructed
new bastions. Portions of the walls which had been
damaged by time were repaired, and new videttes and
towers were erected on the flanks. The residence of
the Count was situated on a mass of wall which commanded
the whole rock and was protected against both
internal and external assault.</p>

<p>The senate saw at once that the obstinacy of the
count rendered their task a very difficult one; and as
the place was deemed impregnable to assault they set
about plans for obtaining it by other means. They
first sent Paolo Pansa to Montobbio to offer Gerolamo
fifty thousand gold crowns of the sun to surrender the
castle; but Fieschi, naturally distrustful of men who
had already violated their solemn pledges of amnesty,
refused to negotiate, replying to Pansa that he held
Montobbio in the name of the king of France and
would defend it to the last extremity.</p>

<p>The news of the Fieschi movement had alarmed all
the friends of the Spanish power. They anticipated
that the rebellion would aid France to diffuse general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
discontent in Italy, and their fears were strengthened
by the connection of the conspiracy with French
intrigues and movements. When therefore Fieschi
declared that he would hold Montobbio for France, his
enemies did not for a moment doubt that the French
king would accept a castle so conveniently placed for
kindling revolutionary fires in Genoa. There was
therefore a general concert of action among the adherents
of the empire to crush out the spark which
otherwise might wrap all Italy in flames. Cosimo
collected his forces in Pisa and put them under the
command of Vitelli. He also ordered the immediate
return of Stefano Colonna from Rome, put him at the
head of the Ducal cavalry, and prepared to risk his
own person in the imperial cause. Gonzaga sent a
large force to the frontiers of Bobbio under the command
of Ludovico Vistarino. Even the cardinal of
Trento sent to Gonzaga to enquire on what point he
should precipitate six thousand men whom he had
collected to aid in crushing the Fieschi. Cæsar ordered
Andrea to invest Montobbio without a moment’s delay,
offering to furnish the men and money for the siege
and empowered the admiral to cede Montobbio, Cariseto
and Varese to the Republic.</p>

<p>The French were not the only enemies before whom
Spain trembled. The adherents of Fieschi in Genoa,
threatened a new outbreak. A rumour ran that
Gianluigi was not dead, but had gone to Provence to
collect men and arms, and the fable found such support
in the popular affection for him that it required a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
time to dissipate the delusion. The plebeians were
expecting him to come to their deliverance and were
on the alert to second his first assault on the common
enemy. Indeed, one night a cry was raised for the
Adorni (the name was synonymous with popular liberty)
and the people rushed to arms to the great fright of
the Dorias. The prince knew the popular faith in
Gianluigi and had lacked the courage to gibbet his
body, according to the custom with traitors, lest it
should raise a popular tempest. Bonfadio, though the
instrument of the Doria faction, admits this to have
been Doria’s motive for refraining from putting this
seal of treason on his enemy. The same historian tells
us that there was a constant peril of a new rising, and
that to prevent it the city guards were increased and
eight citizens appointed to suggest to the senate the
most effectual means of quieting the people and such
additional laws as would meet the exigencies of the
occasion.</p>

<p>Andrea, stimulated by the messages of the emperor
and by his desire to avenge the blood of Gianettino
through the extermination of the Fieschi, made incessant
appeals to the government for the Storming of
Montobbio. The senate yielded to these solicitations
and also empowered Andrea (this we learn from many
documents) to undertake the operation at his own
charge and in the name of the emperor. Agostino
Spinola was ordered to mass his troops and closely
invest the castle. This soldier and scholar had
followed the imperial fortunes since 1536 when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Barnaba Visconti, Bagone and Fregoso attempted to
revolutionize Genoa. After the expulsion of the
French, he held a considerable corps of infantry against
Novi where Origa Gambaro, widow of Pietro Fregosi,
a woman of intrepid character, maintained the war
with the aid of French troops. The valour of Spinola
overcame all obstacles. He opposed courage to
courage, treachery to treachery; and having allied
himself with the Cavanna faction in Novi, he defeated
and destroyed the French army and their leader
Belforte, and thus restored Novi and Ovada to the
Republic.</p>

<p>In the beginning of April 1547, he collected a considerable
body of men and began to make approaches
to the castle of Montobbio. To prevent the introduction
of troops and supplies into the fortress he ordered
Lamba Doria, Bernardo Lomellini and Gabriele
Moneglia to seize the passes of the Apennines and
keep close guard on the frontier. Gonzaga rendered
valuable aid in these operations. He sent captain
Oriola with a company of Spanish infantry to Torriglia
with orders to assist the Genoese generals in divising
means to approach Montobbio.</p>

<p>Though the roads were rocky and broken, Spinola
brought up many guns by the way of the Gioghi and
along the Scrivia, which is formed by the confluence
of the Laccio and Pantemina under the heights of
Montobbio. Flippo Doria, who had already acquired
distinction in naval warfare, was assigned to the
command of the artillery. Andrea required that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Francesco and Domenico Doria should have command
of a body of two thousand infantry. The commissaries
of the Republic were Cristoforo Grimaldo Rosso, and
Leonardo Cattaneo, with Domenico De Franchi, and
Domenico Doria for substitutes.</p>

<p>Count Gerolamo did not lose courage at the sight of
these formidable preparations to assail his stronghold,
but applied himself diligently to increasing his means
of resistance. He fortified the approaches, repaired
the curtains, videttes and battlements, and added new
bastions and other works of defence. He had already
collected a large body of mercenaries and to cover
Montobbio had garrisoned Cariseto and Varese. He
asked vainly for the assistance of the French troops in
Mirandola, and then turned his attention to negotiations
with Pierluigi Farnese. This duke pretended loyalty
to the empire, but he secretly furnished men and
supplies, permitted his vassals in the mountains to
enlist under the standards of Fieschi and instigated the
people of Valnura and Trebbia to obstruct the passes
in front of the imperial troops.</p>

<p>Gerolamo, knowing the worth of Verrina’s advice
and courage and the intrepidity of Assereto and the
band of heroes who had taken refuge in Marseilles,
sent many messengers to urge them to share with him
the peril and glory of the siege. These refugees had
sent Ottobuono and Cornelio Fieschi to the court of
France to plead their cause, and the king had received
them with marks of favour and promised to restore
their fallen fortunes. The assurances were reiterated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
frequently, but the French monarch took no steps to
prove his sincerity. Verrina and Assereto grew weary
of the tedious delay and accepted the invitation of
Gerolamo without awaiting the return of the Fieschi,
preferring the risk of battle to begging for aid which
was always promised but never given. They crossed
Piedmont and found means to enter Montobbio.
Gerolamo received them with joy and committed the
defence to their hands. Later, Ottobuono came to
Mirandola and Verrina and Vicenzo Varese went there
to aid him in urging the French commander to assist
in the defence of the castle. They solicited in vain.
This refusal of France to succour Gerolamo is a new
proof that Gianluigi had not agreed to deliver Genoa
into the hands of the French monarch. Francis was
prodigal of promises, but he left the Fieschi to encounter
the forces of the empire alone.</p>

<p>Spinola planted batteries on a height now called
<i>Costa Rotta</i> near Granara, a village to the west of the
castle; but though he bombarded the citadel for forty
days he was not able to gain one inch of ground, while
the fire of the fortress mowed down the flower of his
troops and daily explosions of his own guns added to
the loss of life. Besides, the inclemency of the season
and incessant rains prevented the formation of lines of
circumvallation. The besieged were greatly encouraged,
and the soldiers of the Republic proportionately demoralized,
by these circumstances. On the tenth of
May the podestà of Recco was ordered to send to
Montobbio as a reinforcement to the besiegers all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
men of that commune between the ages of seventeen
and sixty years.</p>

<p>On the contrary, Paolo Moneglia and Manfredo
Centurione had obtained possession of Varese, with
little loss of life, through the treachery of its commandant,
Giulio Landi, who surrendered it hoping to
obtain the investiture of the feud. But this success
by no means compensated for the losses under the
walls of Montobbio. The castle of Cariseto opposed a
vigorous resistance to the troops of the Republic.
The people of that feud destroyed the roads, constructed
fortifications and closed up the passes which led to the
place. Boniforte Garofolo succeeded at length in
forcing a path across the rugged summits of the
surrounding hills and stormed the out-lying defences.
The attack began at dawn of the 14th of April. The
besieged flocked to the parapets, loop-holes and barbicans,
and with their musquetry and cannon held the
assailants at bay. The battle lasted the entire day.
On the morrow, the Genoese artillery shattered a large
tower which fell burying a considerable part of the
defenders under its ruins. This misfortune discouraged
the rest and they offered to make a conditional surrender
of the place. Garofolo demanded a surrender
at discretion, and the garrison insisted upon security
for their lives and property. Gian Francesco Niselli,
a friend of Fieschi and Pierluigi Farnese, was by
accident in the place at the time of the assault, and he,
seeing the hopelessness of the defence, sent messengers
to Count Paolo Scotti requesting him to obtain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
permission of Farnese for the retreat of the garrison
into the territory of Piacenza. The duke readily consented,
and the peasants and soldiers effected their
retreat in the following night. They lit up fires on
the side of the place which the enemy held and retired
over broken and difficult foot-paths through the
mountains.</p>

<p>The duke had been deeply affected at the death of
Gianluigi; but to avoid a rupture with the empire he
had sent Ottavio Bajardi to Ferrante Gonzaga, offering
his troops and even his own person to the imperial
cause. But he at the same time contrived to have the
Pope secure him immunity from imperial demands.
He sent Agostino Landi, count of Compiano, to congratulate
Doria on his escape from the perils which
had overhung his house and sent back to him a great
number of fugitive slaves, belonging to the Doria
galleys, who had taken refuge in the mountains of
Piacenza. He afterwards sent Salvatore Pocino to the
emperor to deny charges of complicity with Gianluigi.
The emperor knew all the facts and received the envoy
with great coldness; but the duke’s son who was in
the imperial service pleaded more successfully for his
father.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the large imperial army, which had been
massed in Varese to support the siege of Montobbio,
kept the duke in constant apprehension that it might
be destined to punish him for his treachery. These
fears were strengthened by the fact that Gonzaga had
added to Vistarino and Oriola five other captains,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Sebastiano Picenardi, Lodovico da Borgo, Pier Francesco
Trecco, Osio Casale and Gianfrancesco Ali, with
considerable bodies of troops and strict orders to levy
new recruits in Monticello and Castelvetro, feuds of
the duke. To provide for the danger, Farnese, who
had Cornelio Fieschi under his protection, reorganized
the army of twelve thousand infantry which he had
collected in January at Cortemaggiore, sent commissaries
to forbid enrolment of imperial troops in his
feuds, fortified the castles in his jurisdiction, placed six
hundred infantry at Borgo, a greater number at Bardi
and ordered Francesco Clerici commanding at Compiano
to be on the alert and in constant readiness for battle.
Shortly after he instructed his commissioner in Venice
to ask the consent of that Republic to his drawing eight
thousand arquebuses from Brescia. He was allowed
to draw only five thousand. These operations led to
reciprocal suspicions, rancours and threats between
Farnese and the imperial captains, and Gonzaga, to
prevent an open outbreak, recalled Vistarino from
Bobbio.</p>

<p>This measure relieved Farnese from his present peril
and he resolved to take advantage of the siege of
Montobbio to get possession, in advance of the imperial
troops, of some feuds of the Fieschi. He seized
Calestano, and then sent Gianantonio Torti with a
strong force to occupy Valditaro. As the Fieschi had
some imperial vassals in these feuds, Farnese informed
Gonzaga that he wished to hold them for the interests
and rights of the empire. He did not wait for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
answer, but hurried his troops into the feuds. His
designs upon Valditaro were thwarted by Scipione and
Cornelio Fieschi, who threw themselves into it with
about one thousand of their vassals and shut the gates
in the faces of the Ducal forces. He called Scipione
to himself in Piacenza and persuaded him that the
forces of his family were too weak to contend with the
empire. Scipione consented that the duke should
occupy the castle in the interest of his family. He
returned to his vassals and persuaded them to enlist
in the service of Farnese, who sent his agent, doctor
Giovanni Landemaria, to take possession in his name.
The acts of the notary Bartolomeo Bosoni clearly prove
these facts.</p>

<p>Gonzaga was enraged at this stratagem of Farnese;
and in fact the occupation was of short duration. On
the death of Farnese, Valditaro was created a principate
by the emperor and passed to Agostino Landi whose
ancestors had once held it. The inhabitants always
retained their love for the Fieschi house, and remembered
long the mild government of their old
masters. They several times conspired to restore
Scipione who was born among them. In 1552, Gonzaga,
incensed at these movements, instigated Landi
to dismantle the forts and towers lest they should
afford a place of refuge for the Fieschi.</p>

<p>More than ten thousand balls had been thrown at
Montobbio; but the Fieschi, safe in their defences,
laughed at the rage of the assailants and their own fire
often seriously damaged the enemy. The people of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
surrounding country scarcely concealed their sympathy
for the besieged and furnished the castle with meat
and provisions of every kind. The commissioners of
the Republic complained of this and said that the
inhabitants of Bargagli, Stroppa and other villages
never brought even an egg to the camp of the Genoese,
while they gave liberal supplies to the enemy. Spinola,
despairing of success in the siege, united with the
commissaries in urging the government to attempt a
new negotiation.</p>

<p>At this time Doria learned of the death of king
Francis, and this event removed all apprehension that
the French would relieve Montobbio and attack the
Spanish power in Italy. The recent victory of the
emperor over Frederick of Saxony at Elbe stimulated
Andrea to a more enthusiastic support of the imperial
cause and to make a vigorous opposition to the proposals
of accommodation which the senate assembled
to discuss. He declaimed wrathfully against the
shameful cowardice of making terms with traitors and
declared that the Fieschi could hope nothing from
France, because the new king Henry II. could not, if
he wished it, devote any attention in the first month of
his reign to the petty concerns of Montobbio and its
handful of defenders. Though the majority of the
senate favoured a treaty with Gerolamo, the powerful
will of Doria prevailed and new troops were sent to
Spinola. The prince sent to the duke of Florence for
bombardiers, munitions and other military material of
which there was a scarcity in the army of Genoa. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
duke furnished these and a considerable force of
infantry under Paolo da Castello; Ferrante Gonzaga
sent two companies of four hundred arquebusiers,
Filippo Doria was ordered by Andrea to make new
surveys of the heights around Montobbio and to
endeavour to place his artillery in better positions,
and this general moved his guns to the less elevated
height called Olmeto in our time and renewed the
attack.</p>

<p>This bombardment produced no better results than
the first one and the siege must have failed had not
fortune opened a new and easier road to victory. A
general order forbade any person not in the army to
approach within two miles of the bastions under penalty
of death. One day a soldier of the garrison dressed as
a mountaineer was arrested in the act of examining
the works of the besiegers, and on his person were
found letters of Gerolamo to his brother Ottobuono.
In these letters the count declared that he could not
continue the defence for more than three months as his
military supplies were insufficient for a longer period,
and he urged Ottobuono to secure the immediate aid
of France. Spinola was greatly encouraged by this
discovery of the weakness of his adversary. He
detained the soldier for some days and then, having
seduced him by splendid promises, sent him back to
Montobbio with a false letter of Ottobuono, in which
the writer informed the count of the death of king
Francis and declared that the only hope of the besieged
was in an accommodation with the senate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>This intelligence greatly dispirited the garrison, in
whom the want of supplies and the obstinate courage
of the besiegers were beginning to produce apprehension.
But desperation lent them new strength and they made
several bold sorties which seriously damaged the enemy.
To the want of supplies, a new and more dangerous
evil was soon added. The mercenaries collected by
Fieschi in the neighbouring feuds, being poorly fed and
receiving no pay, began to murmur and finally refused
to expose themselves to further peril. The count found
that his own life was threatened by these rebellious
soldiers, and in letters written on the 20th of March
to Gian Maria Manara in Valditaro he asked ten faithful
men to serve as a guard of his own person. Manara
was a physician by profession and had so much influence
with the Fieschi that they had left him to
govern at pleasure the whole valley of the Taro. He
furnished the men and obtained other reënforcements
from captain Mengo da Montedoglio who commanded
in Valditaro for Farnese. Gerolamo also sent a
messenger to Cardinal Farnese to ask asylum in the
church of that prelate in case he should be reduced to
extremities. In this he was successful, and the cardinal
also wrote to the Duke of Piacenza to give Gerolamo
all possible aid.</p>

<p>During the first days of May the siege was prosecuted
with increased vigour. The artillery of Filippo
Doria poured a storm of shot into the castle, the walls
fell down in large pieces and the outer curtains were
ruined. There were many indications that the resistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
could not long continue. Still, the subordinates
of Gerolamo restored during the night the
damage caused by the Ligurian and Florentine guns
during the day and there was no sign of discouragement
in the intrepid leaders. But the mercenaries
continued to murmur and to refuse obedience to the
commanders, complaining of their privations and
demanding their wages. The count saw that it was
necessary to surrender. Gerolamo Garaventa and
Tommaso Assereto went to the camp of Spinola and
offered to yield the place but on terms which the
victors would not accept.</p>

<p>The Genoese general resolved to make a final assault
upon the work. He sent trumpeters to proclaim that
all who wished to save their lives must come within
his lines; all who resisted the assault would be put to
the sword. But though they had been many days in
great privation, only two of the soldiers of Fieschi
obeyed the summons. The assault was begun with
great fury and, added to the discontent of the mercenaries,
convinced Fieschi that he must surrender at
once. He offered Spinola the castle on condition that
the lives and goods of the defenders should be
respected.</p>

<p>The senate met in Genoa to consider this proposition
and the debate shows that the Fieschi had many
sympathizers in the senate and that Andrea Doria was
the real master of the Republic. After two days of
discussion the senate resolved to accept the offers of
Fieschi.The count, who knew how little value the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>pledges of the government really possessed, asked to
be secured against the vengeance of Andrea Doria.
The senate promised to secure the assent of Andrea to
the negotiation and applied to him for the purpose.
But the prince, who knew that Gerolamo was now in
his power, refused his coöperation and the senate had
not the courage to maintain their position.</p>

<p>The garrison at Montobbio were greatly distressed
by this attitude of Doria. All means of obtaining
provisions were cut off, and they must soon be reduced
by starvation. Still, they held a bold front to the
enemy and resolved to die fighting rather than
surrender at discretion. But the mercenaries broke
into open rebellion and the more desperate, after
demanding their pay on the instant, seized a tower
which had hitherto defied all the enemy’s guns and
surrendered it to the soldiers of the Republic. The
count and his faithful soldiers were obliged to take
shelter in a wing of the fortress. The treason of the
adventurers (which is spoken of not only in inedited
documents but also by Adriani) took away all hope
from the defenders. They resolved to imitate the
garrison of Cariseto and retire by night over the rugged
and almost inaccessible heights in their rear. But
Vicenzo Calcagno reminded them that the count, who
was corpulent of body, would not be able to make so
fatiguing a march over wild mountain paths and that
the troops of Doria held all the passes behind them.
Assereto and some others resolved to risk the journey
and set out; but after a fatiguing march over toilsome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
foot-paths they were surrounded and forced to surrender.
The count who still hoped that the Republic
would make good its promises yielded the castle to
Spinola, who entered it with flying banners on the
morning of the 11th of June.</p>

<p>Spinola, as a faithful servant of Andrea, ordered his
Corsicans as soon as he had taken possession of the
works to execute Calcagno, Manara and some other
partisans of the count suspected of having participated
in the murder of Gianettino. Domenico Doria, il Converso,
also made some executions. The rest, including
the mercenaries, were held as prisoners of war. But
these last only were permitted to depart on parole.
Count Gerolamo, Verrina and Assereto were reserved
for public execution in the city and were treated with
great inhumanity.</p>

<p>At the news of the surrender of Montobbio, the
senate again assembled. Most of the senators held
that one of the first families of Italy, bound by relationship
to the most illustrious houses, ought not to
be plunged into deeper calamity. They plead with
Doria. The Fieschi had been sufficiently punished by
the confiscation of their property, the destruction of
their houses and the death of Gianluigi. Why vent
unchristian rage on the heads of Gerolamo and his
brothers? They were unfortunate young men to whom
the plots of their brother had been unknown. Gianluigi
had suddenly precipitated them into rebellion
and they deserved pardon for their almost involuntary
share in the conspiracy. Let Doria open his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
heart to more generous, to more magnanimous counsels.
Let him imitate the example of Cæsar who would not
condemn to death the Saxon whom he had conquered
in battle.</p>

<p>Doria was deaf to these appeals of the senators. He
refused all compromises. The Fieschi and their companions
must die. The writers in the Doria interest
do not disguise this fact. Mascardi says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Those who favoured clemency were in the majority.
They urged that forbearance was a necessary quality
in governments, that the violence of Gianluigi mitigated
the guilt of his confederates and that the youth of his
brothers ought to extenuate their offence. Andrea
Doria was greatly displeased to see the Republic so
basely betrayed, and going into the senate he spoke
with so much force and authority that the unfortunate
men were condemned to death.”</p>

<p>In the monastery of St. Andrea della Porta lived a
sister of the Fieschi named Suor Angela Catterina.
She imitated the example of the two pious women in
her family, of whom we have elsewhere spoken, and she
was held in high esteem. As soon as she heard of the
condemnation of her brother, Gerolamo, she made the
most earnest supplications to the government on his
behalf.</p>

<p>“I could not,” said the afflicted sister, “abandon a
brother in such a terrible calamity. That God, whom
human judges ought to imitate, is compassionate as
well as just with sinners. Senators should remember
that Gerolamo was drawn into the conspiracy of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
brother without any previous knowledge of his intentions,
and, that he himself has never plotted against
the Republic, that he surrendered Montobbio with the
confident expectation that the senate would spare his
life. The senate should keep faith and pardon this son
of Sinibaldo one of the warmest advocates and defenders
of the union and liberty of the country. Let them
remember what Christ said: ‘Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy;’ almost beside myself with
grief and more dead than alive, I fall at the feet of the
prince and conjure him by the mercy of Christ to
pardon my poor brother.” It was in vain. She was
encouraged to hope, but the pardon never came. The
senate had not the courage to take the victim out of
the hands of Doria.</p>

<p>The populace was still agitated and full of seditious
plans. Though a deep mystery enveloped the action
of the government, the people suspected the vindictive
intention of Doria and threatened revolt. This led
the government to transfer the execution from Genoa
to Montobbio. Two priests were at once despatched
to the castle, Gian Maria Paulocio, one of the officers
of the Ruota, and Tommaso Doria, to examine the
prisoners and report their defence to the senate.</p>

<p>Soon after the <i>Podesta</i> for criminal cases was also
sent, under decree of the 4th of July. This was
Polidamante del Majno a man of considerable talents.
The count, Verrina and other leaders were subjected to
the rope torture, a useless barbarity because they were
already condemned to death. Polidamante tried every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
means to escape this painful office, and we learn from
some letters of his to the senate that he had protested
against being commissioned for the examination.</p>

<p>The Republic had begun by declaring the Fieschi
guilty of high treason and denying them trial or
defence. He subsequently wrote to the senate: “If
your excellencies do not make some change, I shall be
in a very painful position and people may justly think
that I prosecute this unfortunate affair (maladetta
causa) with personal motives. You know how I
laboured to relieve myself from this duty. Therefore
I beseech you to relieve me at once from my present
embarrassment by declaring clearly that we may admit
new testimony, or by revoking your second decree, and
proceeding logically by carrying out your first executive
mandate.” The senate solved the difficulty by
ordering the punishment of the prisoners without trial.
The common soldiers were pardoned. Some of the
conspirators were condemned to the halter, others to
the oar.</p>

<p>The sentence was executed on the 23rd of July.
Desiderio Cangialanza was the first to mount the
scaffold and he was followed by some whose names
history has not preserved. It was too busy with
laudations of Doria and invectives against the fallen.
Gerolamo, Verrina and Assereto, being patricians,
were beheaded in the chapel of San Rocco at the foot
of the fortress. Servile as was the age it was forced
to admire the heroic bearing of Verrina whose character
was cast in the old Roman mould. He was twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
tortured, but he would not utter a word about the
secrets of the conspiracy. The night preceeding his
execution he spoke with serenity of the doctrines to
which he had given his faith, and encouraged his
companions to meet their last hour with courageous
composure. He went to the scaffold with the step
rather of a conqueror than of a criminal.</p>

<p>The sentence of death embraced the exiles Ottobuono
and Cornelio, and, what is more iniquitous, the youthful
Scipione and his descendants to the fifth generation
were banished. Some writers have maintained that
Sacco was also executed at Montobbio. But though
the documents relating to the treaty with Gerolamo
are few and it is apparent that many have been
surreptitiously removed from the public archives, yet
we have been so fortunate as to find some letters of
Sacco himself which entirely invalidate this statement.
Another person has already printed some of them.
His correspondence with Luigi Ferrero of Savona, in
February, show that he was then in Turin on his way
back from France.</p>

<p>In Turin he was befriended by presidents Catto and
Birago. The latter concealed him in one of his own
houses on the banks of the Po. He had friends, kept
up party affiliations, and hoped that the recent death
of the English monarch would occasion a war in Italy.
In other letters, addressed to his wife Alessandra, he
alludes to his hope of French interference and expresses
an intention of returning to that court. He gives her
advice for the management of domestic affairs and recommends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
her to Nicolò Doria, Antonio De Fornari
and Giovanni Gerolamo Salvago. There is a letter to
count Gerolamo Fieschi in which he asks a hundred
crowns and letters of recommendations to the king of
France, Delfino, the admiral and the cardinals Tornone
and Ferrara. He exhorts the count to be diligent in
furnishing his fortresses and to put on a bold front in
order to discourage his enemies and inspirit his friends.
The records of the trial show that the Ferrero gave
these letters to the senate. The most important of
these epistles is the one written in July to Pietro
Francesco Grimaldi Robio, doctor of the college of
judges, in which he exculpates himself from the charge
made by Verrina of having been the first instigator of
the conspiracy. He shows that Verrina had been the
beginning, middle and end of the plot. He says that
if Calcagno were alive, he would fully exculpate him
from the accusations; but as this person was dead it
only remained for him to recite all the facts of the
conspiracy. This history he says will show him to
have been innocent. His only fault was that he
had been born in Savona. Had he been a Genoese
he would have communicated his first knowledge of
the plot to the senate and thus escaped condemnation,
or be as lightly punished as many of his present
accusers. He admits that he concealed the conspiracy
but asks: “Ought I to have denounced the count, my
master and exposed him to death and infamy? If this
silence is a fault, I do not hesitate to accept the
responsibility of it, I have already written to the Doge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
and I repeat, that if the senate will send to Turin a
person in whom they have confidence I will recite the
whole story of the plot. I do not say this to beg
pardon for what I have done, but to disprove unjust
charges heaped upon my name.” These are the
customary phrases of informers.</p>

<p>These papers show that Sacco was not involved in
the condemnation of his accomplices. For the rest,
we are not permitted to know what was the nature of
his revelations, because the most important papers of
this trial are wanting. We believe, however, that
some mutilated documents refer to this matter. We
learn from them that a certain Filippo di Graveggia
carried letters under the saddle of a mule to Parma,
Bologna and other cities.</p>

<p>Having restored order, the government informed its
friends of the taking of Montobbio, especially Duke
Cosimo whose aid had been so valuable to the besiegers.
But there were ominous signs of discontent in all
classes of the people in every part of the Republic.
The government sent Tommaso Spinola and Antonio
Doria to Henry II. to condole with him on the death
of his father and congratulate him on his accession to
the throne; but the more important part of their
business was to spy out the movements of the Fieschi
and to render them obnoxious at the court where the
name was held in such high esteem.</p>

<p>The fortress of Montobbio shared the fate of the
palace in Vialata. The government, in concert with
Doria and Figueroa, decreed on the 11th of June that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
it should be levelled with the earth, “so that,” said the
proclamation, “no evidence may remain that any
fortification has ever existed there.” Even the brow
of the mountain was ordered to be thrown into the
valley so that no castle could ever be erected on the
site. Whoever should attempt to build there was
declared a rebel and his goods confiscated to the state.</p>

<p>Prince Doria assumed the charge of this demolition,
but the expense was borne by the Republic. Giovanni
Bozzo, podestà of Montobbio, reported on the 10th of
August that Paolo di Mirandola had excavated three
mines under the castle, one on the East side seventy-six
palms in length with openings at the two sides;
the second, on the South, ran twenty palms into the
mountain from the bank of the stream, the third, on
the West side where the principal battery had stood,
penetrated a distance of ten palms. Mirandola, he
reports, declared that the mines must be extended as
the castle had the strength of steel. The explosion of
these mines blew the whole work to the ground reducing
it at once to a total ruin.</p>

<p>In our time even the face of nature is changed.
Wild weeds grow on that slope where gardens once
bloomed. The daffodils which breathe their perfume
over the place are the only witnesses to ancient culture.
A beautiful lake which lay at the foot of the castle has
disappeared. It probably covered a spot to which
tradition gives the name <i>Lago della Signora</i>.</p>

<p class="pch">PIER LUIGI FARNESE.</p>

<p class="pcs">The ferocity and excesses of Andrea Doria&mdash;The benefits which he
derived from the fall of the Fieschi&mdash;The Farnesi participated
in Genoese conspiracies&mdash;Schemes of Andrea against the duke
of Piacenza&mdash;Landi is instigated by Andrea to kill the duke&mdash;The

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> office of historian becomes a painful one when
we are required to describe some of the actions of
Andrea Doria, actions which throw a shade over his
fame, and take away a part of his laurels from the
greatest admiral of Italy. It is a work of simple
devotion to truth to show that Andrea maintained the
Spanish power in the Peninsula, and that he overstepped
all bounds in his rage against the defeated
Fieschi. Sismondi says that the prince in destroying
his enemies to avenge Gianettino went to lengths of
ferocity unworthy of a great man.</p>

<p>He had applied to himself that saying of Lorenzo
di Medici: “While there are <i>Gatti</i> in Genoa the
Republic will never have peace, and perhaps on this
account found it easier to obtain Medicean aid in
exterminating these <i>Gatti</i>.” At all events he gave
himself no rest while the work of destruction remained
incomplete. He embraced in his scheme of vengeance
the Strozzi and their allies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>The activity of Andrea was wonderful. Wherever
he had representatives, public or private, thither flew
his messages and messengers. He neglected nothing
at home or abroad. Politics, arms, arts, commerce&mdash;he
had his eye on everything&mdash;on the exiles especially.
Aided by Cosimo, he set an assassin named Bastiano
da Finale to dodge the steps of Piero Strozzi who was
marching to Siena. He employed seven assassins to
murder Ottobuono, Scipione and Cornelio Fieschi. We
learn from Venitian letters preserved in the Tuscan
archives that one of these wretches accompanied by
two companions went several times to Venice to
assassinate the brothers of Gianluigi. This correspondence
relates that this assassin was artfully banished
from Genoa as a popular conspirator, as a means of
giving him access to the Genoese exiles, though he was
secretly recommended by Doria to the ambassador of
the emperor. Doria would have better provided for
his fame if, content with depriving the Fieschi of the
means of revolution, he had declined the services of
bravos and refused the price of blood so lavishly offered
by the emperor.</p>

<p>After the capture of Montobbio, Doria, under orders
from Cæsar invested the Republic (February 29th,
1548) with the feuds of that place, of Varese and
Roccatagliata. Cristoforo Lercaro had already occupied
the last in the name of Genoa. The cession was made
to appear as a gift, though the Republic already
possessed the right of eminent domain over Roccatagliata
and the valley of Neirone. The governor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Milan held fast to Pontremoli, in order, as Doria
advised, to keep that strong post then the key of the
Lombard provinces, in imperial hands. Gonzaga also
occupied Loano, Carrega, Grondona, Borbagia, San
Stefano d’Aveto, Calice, Veppo and other castles, a part
of which Charles (June 19th 1548) gave in feud to
various partisans of the empire. This was not imperial
munificence, but king-craft and a device to strengthen
the Spanish power in Liguria. Andrea obtained some
wealthy feuds, among them Torriglia, (which was
erected into a marquisate) Carrega, Garbagna, Grondona
and ten other castles. San Stefano d’Aveto was ceded
to Antonio Doria who was hiring four galleys to the
empire. Ettore Fieschi, of the Savignone branch,
received some feuds as a reward for not having shared
in the conspiracy of his relatives. The castle of
Castelano was ceded to the Duke of Parma. Agostino
Landi retained the burgh of Valditaro. This Landi
had promised to assassinate Pierluigi Farnese whom
Doria had condemned to death for his secret intrigues
with Gianluigi. It is worth our while to clear up the
history of this part of Andrea’s vengeance.</p>

<p>The cities of Parma and Piacenza, having been
detached from the duchy of Milan and put into the
hands of the Holy See, were ceded by Paul III. to his
natural son Pier Luigi Farnese who had been legitimated
in 1501 by Julius II. To secure his son in this
new duchy, the Pope supported Charles in the German
war and in his expedition to Tunis, where, aided
by Doria the emperor restored the inhuman Muley-Hassan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
to the throne which he mounted by the assassination
of his twenty-two brothers. The alliance of
Farnese with the empire was cemented by the marriage
of Pierluigi’s son, Ottavio, with Margaret a natural
daughter of Cæsar and widow of Alessandro de Medici.
Francis Sforza died and the duchy of Milan reverted
to the empire giving rise to a war with France. The
Pope thought to gain profit for Pier Luigi out of this
contest for the duchy by securing him the investiture,
and Cæsar, at the conference of Busseto, promised to
grant the pontiff’s request. The emperor did not keep
his pledge and the Pope began to abandon the imperial
cause. He reproached Charles with the fact that
certain prelates devoted to the empire had proposed in
the council of Trent innovations on the rights of the
Papal See, and expressed his discontent with the mild,
treatment of the partisans of Luther in Germany. He
went further and began to intrigue, in 1547, for a
league with France against Charles.</p>

<p>Francis I. at the moment when he was most zealously
engaged in uniting England, Germany and Italy
against Spain was stricken by death at Rambouillet
after a twenty years’ conflict with the increasing power
of Charles Fifth. The emperor now saw himself without
a rival and hastened to take advantage of the
occasion. He renewed hostilities against the Duke of
Saxony, though his army had been thinned by the
withdrawal of the Papal troops. It is not our purpose
to recount the story of this Germanic war. Charles
conducted it to a successful termination because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
affairs of Italy no longer distracted his attention. But
his victories over the league of Smacalda increased the
suspicions and fears of Paul III. who saw that if
Charles was successful in Germany he would be master
at the council of Trent. It was no secret that the
emperor designed to take that occasion for avenging
himself on the Pope for sympathy with the Fieschi
and France. The Roman court was too jealous of its
prerogatives not to be alarmed at the prospect of
having its power limited by an ambitious monarch
favourably disposed towards the policy of the German
reformers. It was thought necessary to remove the
seat of the council to some city nearer to Rome
and more under Papal influence, where Charles
could not intrigue nor display his arms with so much
effect.</p>

<p>Fortune favoured the Pope. Some of the assembled
prelates fell sick and the physicians, especially Fracastoro
who was employed by Rome for the business,
reported that a fierce contagion had broken out in the
city. Many of the prelates abandoned Trent in great
haste and the council was removed to Bologna. The
cardinals and bishops of the imperial faction remained
in Trent by express order of Charles. The remainder,
thirty-four in number, accompanied the Papal legates.
There were mutual recriminations and the very council
assembled to destroy scism was menaced with a scism
in its own bosom.</p>

<p>Cæsar made angry appeals and intrigued adroitly to
secure the reassembling of the Synod in Trent. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
Pope refused, and Charles avenged himself by that
decree of <i>Interim</i>, in which he declared that until
the council should be reconvoked in Trent every
one was at liberty to think as he pleased in matters
of religion. The decree occasioned great scandal in
the church.</p>

<p>“It was believed,” says Varchi, “that the emperor
wished to restore the Papacy to the simplicity and
poverty of times when prelates did not meddle with
temporal government but contented themselves with
their spiritual functions. The gross abuses and vile
practices of the Roman court had awakened in many
an ardent desire for such a reform.” This gave
bitterness to the enmity between the Pope and Charles.
The pontiff directed his hostilities especially against
the two imperial ministers in Italy, Anotonio Leyva
and Andrea Doria. On the death of the first, the whole
weight of Papal displeasure fell on the head of the
latter, who earlier in life had received from Rome a
consecrated sword and hat for his victories over the
Turks. We have elsewhere shown how the opposition
of Doria to the growth of the Farnese family and his
other acts hostile to Paul III. had led the latter to
favour the Fieschi conspiracy against Doria and Spain.
Some deny that Paul favoured the conspirators and
adduced the testimony of Don Appollonio Filareto,
secretary to Pier Luigi Farnese. This secretary, though
confined for three years as a prisoner in Milan and put
to torture, steadfastly denied that the French knew of
the plans of Fieschi. But this is contradicted both by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the current opinion of that time and by authentic and
credible documents extant. Charles was so certain of
the complicity of the Pope with Fieschi, that when
Paul sent Camillo Orsino to Madrid to complain to the
emperor of the murder of his son Pier Luigi and ask
the restitution of Piacenza to the Apostolic See, he
boldly charged the pontiff with this crime.</p>

<p>As soon as Andrea learned through the ministers of
Cæsar that Paul had been concerned in the Fieschi
movement, and that Pier Luigi had given material aid
to Gianluigi he was inflamed with an ardent desire to
punish old and new treacheries by a signal act of
vengeance. From that hour, Farnese was condemned
to the fate of the Fieschi. Moreover, in gratifying his
own passion for revenge, Andrea was furthering the
schemes of Charles. He launched himself into the
matter with the ardour of youth.</p>

<p>The news that Charles was suffering from a mortal
sickness filled Doria with apprehension of wide-spread
conspiracy against Spain in case of the emperor’s death.
Pier Luigi, in fact, as soon as he received the same
intelligence, began to raise troops, fortify castles and
enlist able commanders among whom were Bartolomeo
Villachiara, Sforza Santa Fiore, Sforza Pallavicino and
Alessandro Tommasoni da Terni. He collected arms
everywhere. We find in old documents that he bought
at one time four thousand arquebuses, for a gold crown
each, from the celebrated Venturino del Chino,
armourer of Gordone in Valtrompia. Bonfadio tells
us that these military preparations awakened grave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
suspicions in the neighbouring cities of the empire who
feared that these arms were to be used against themselves.
The fear of revolution was widely diffused.
Doria could not be an idle witness of this drawing of
swords in places so near, especially after the share of
Farnese in the Fieschi plot. He had then two motives
for prompt action; to secure the safety of the empire
and to avenge the blood of Gianettino.</p>

<p>Pier Luigi has been traduced by the malice of
writers in the Spanish interest. It is true that
Cellini declares him avaricious, and many historians
affirm that he was intemperate and a votary of
licentious pleasures. Even Aretino admonished him
to husband more carefully the strength of his manhood.
But the fable of Varchi that he ravished Cosimo
Gheri, bishop of Fano, though repeated in our days
has no longer any supporters. It is now beyond
question that the story began with Pier Paolo Vergerio,
a malignant slanderer of Farnese. The slander was
refuted at the time by Bishop Della Casa in the time
of Vergerio, and later by Ammiani, Poggiali, Morandi,
Cardinal Quirino and Apostolo Zeno, not to mention
many others. Pier Luigi was great by rank and by
nature. He restrained the arrogance of his nobles and
had studied much to elevate his people to an equality
with their lords. He was supported in these plans by
the distinguished literary men who served as his
secretaries; Claudio Tolomei, Giovanni Battista Pico,
David Spilimbergo, Gandolfo Porrino, Giovanni Paccini,
Gottifredi, Rainerio, Zuccardi, Tebalducci, Apollonio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
and Caro. The last after the death of his master was
pursued by assassins and with great difficulty saved
his life by fleeing into the province of Cremona.</p>

<p>This open friendship of Farnese for the people, at a
time when the lords were everywhere practising great
severity, added to the hatred of the imperial agents
and whetted their desire for vengeance. There was
still another cause of quarrel. The port of the Po at
Piacenza had been ceded by Paul III. to the divine
Bonarotti (taking away certain rights upon it from the
Pusterla and Trivulzio) and Bonarotti had rented it to
Francesco Durante, and the nobles taking the sides of
the defrauded parties resolved to wreak their vengeance
on the pontiff’s son. A conspiracy was formed at the
head of which were Giovanni Anguissola, Camillo and
Gerolamo Pallavicini and Giovanni Confaloniere. But
the soul of the plot was count Agostino Landi, the
same person who informed the government at Lucca
of the conspiracy of Pietro Fatinelli, and thus betrayed
him to death.</p>

<p>Andrea opened his heart to Landi and showed him
the golden promises of Cæsar. Casoni relates this and
he founded it upon irrefragible proofs which he had
in his hands. He adds that the prince pledged to
Landi the hand of the sister of Gianettino for his son
with a wealthy dowry. This marriage afterwards took
place. It was important that, after the assassination
of the duke, the duchy of Piacenza should revert to
the empire, and to secure this result Doria intrigued
with Gerolamo Pallavicino, Marquis of Cortemaggiore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and Busseto, whose mother and wife had been held in
captivity by Farnese and who was therefore anxious
to punish the affront. The conspirators in Piacenza
at first really intended to establish a popular government;
but Doria adroitly induced them to communicate
with Gonzaga. It was not difficult then to secure the
subjection of Piacenza to the empire.</p>

<p>A warm animosity burned between Gonzaga and the
duke on account of the priorship of Barletta which
Gonzaga had obtained for his son to the exclusion of
Horace Farnese. Gonzaga made many attempts upon
the life of Pier Luigi. Annibal Caro, who in July,
1547 was sent by the latter to Milan informed his
master of these plots; but the duke had no presentiment
of his imminent peril. The efforts of Gonzaga,
however, all failed, and with the knowledge of Charles,
he sent captain Federico Gazzino to order the conspirators
to proceed with their work.</p>

<p>On the tenth of December 1547 Giovanni Anguissola
went to the castle which Farnese had erected to
command the city and demanded instant speech of the
duke on matters of pressing urgency. Having entered,
Anguissola and his friend Giovanni Valentino threw
themselves upon the duke and killed him with stabs
in his face and breast. On leaving the apartment, the
assassin killed a priest and a servant who were rushing
in to ascertain the occasion of the duke’s cries, struck
down a German lancer who threw himself before him
and ran to rejoin his fellow conspirators, who, led by
Confaloniere immediately overpowered the garrison of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
the citadel. Others, headed by Landi and the Pallavicini
brothers, attacked and soon captured the castle
with but little loss of life. Some mercenaries fleeing
from the citadel spread a report that the Spaniards had
attacked the castle; and the plebians, to whom the
very name Spaniards was odious, rose in arms, gathered
around Tommasoni da Terni, captain of the city militia,
and marched to the citadel to recover it by storm.</p>

<p>The battle could not have been long or doubtful; for
only thirty-seven conspirators were in possession of the
fortress. But they invented an expedient which served
them in the stead of force. They hung the corpse of
the duke to the wall and afterwards threw it into the
moat. The sight destroyed the hopes of the people.
The conspirators found means to increase the number
of their adherents and to occupy the city. Captain
Ruschino arrived before the gates, according to a previous
understanding, at the head of a considerable body
of infantry and shortly after the castellan of Cremona
arrived with reinforcements. These were followed by
Gonzaga himself who took possession in the name of
Cæsar. The vengeance of Doria was complete.</p>

<p>The Venitians were greatly grieved by these events;
indeed, all the governments in Italy which were
unfriendly to the Spanish power were alarmed at its
success. The nobles of Piacenza regretted too late
that they had changed masters without gaining their
liberties. Gonzaga had promised to destroy the citadel,
but he increased its strength and it remained for three
centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Piacenza was never restored to the Farnese in spite
of that spirited discourse which Casa wrote to Cæsar
and which we find in his works. The Pope in full
concistory asked an account from the emperor of the
assassination of his son and the seizure of Piacenza, and
demanded the punishment of Gonzaga. But the
emperor pleased with his success, paid no attention
either to the threats of the Pope or the appeals of his
son-in-law and Margaret. Gonzaga was not even
content with Piacenza but attempted to grasp Parma
also. He moved an army against it, but the valour of
Camillo Orsino rendered his efforts fruitless. To
secure his grandson against Spanish treachery, Paul
kept him near his own person in Rome, until Ottavio,
weary of living in privacy put himself into the power
of the ministers of Charles and returned to Parma.
The old pontiff, pricked to the heart by the death of
his son and the fruitlessness of his appeals to other
governments against Spain, soon ended his days in
bitterness and sorrow (1549).</p>

<p>Though the assassins of Farnese obtained rewards
from the emperor they were long the objects of
atrocious persecutions from Rome. Anguissola was
created governor of Como; but he sought refuge from
many assassins who dodged his steps in the Pliniana
villa which he had constructed. Beleseur, French
ambassador, having encountered him in the Grisons
tried to pierce him in the very palace of the bishop
with the dagger of papal vengance. A certain Rinaldo
Rondinello, of the mountains of Cesena, long followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
him in the mantle of a friar; and when this assassin
was punished, many others rose up to take his place,
until Anguissola seeing himself the object of universal
scorn and the mark of every stiletto terminated his
miserable life in sorrow and remorse. Gerolamo
Pallavicini who with his brother Alessando and others
was an accomplice in that crime was making the campaign
in Flanders in 1552, in company with his
relatives. Eight masked men one day assailed him,
killed all his relatives and left him stretched upon the
earth with five severe wounds. However, he recovered
and retired to his castle of Castiglione di Lodi, which
he had obtained from the Fieschi. He made a vow
to marry the first woman whom he should meet.
Fate was propitious and Gerolamina Virotelli, the
daughter of a mountaineer and a woman of more
than womanly prudence, made the evening of his life
cheerful. Count Landi died in remorse and bequeathed
a rich legacy to the heir of the murdered Farnese
Gonzaga, too, died miserably. Some assassins, Corsican
soldiers of Ottavio Farnese, several times attempted to
kill him; but it was reserved for the Genoese to avenge
on him the death of the Fieschi and Farnese, and his
other crimes. Tommaso Marini and Ottobuono Giustiniani
obtained a decree from Charles, that Gonzaga be
subjected to an examination for the robberies with
which he was charged. The emperor acquitted him,
but removed him from the governorship of Milan
and the disgrace so wounded him that he died of
his grief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>These acts of vengeance were followed by others of
a fierce character. In these, Andrea Doria was the
instructor. At the death of Pier Luigi nothing remained
for him but to punish the Pope for his complicity
with the Count of Lavagna; but the elevation
of Paul and the sanctity of his office put him out of
the reach of personal violence. Other arms than
daggers must be employed, and fortune put them into
the hands of Doria. We must here premise that after
the death of Gianluigi, the Pope, to suppress the
rumour that he was accessory to the conspiracy, sent
Andrea a brief, condoling with him for the death of
Gianettino. The fierce Genoese, who well knew the
arts of Roman wolves, swallowed his resentiment and
was silent until the time arrived to settle his account
with the successor of St. Peter. As soon as he learned
through Cristoforo Lercaro Di Salvo, captain of
Chiavari, that Pier Luigi was dead, he took that same
brief, changed only the names and sent it back to the
author as <i>his</i> letter of condolence for the death of the
pontiff’s son. The injury was great; but the punishment
was terrible.</p>

<p>These punishments and assassinations did not restore
order and confidence. The blood which had been
spilled fertilized the soil for a new harvest of disaster
and suffering.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Charles V.</span> had long cherished the design of rendering
the entire Peninsula subject to his authority. He was
master of the Sicilies and the Milanese and controlled
Tuscany through the servility of Cosimo; and if he
were able to complete the conquest of Genoa, it would
be easy to expel the French army from Piedmont
where Henry II. was preparing to renew the war in
Italy. It is true that the emperor through the senate
and Doria actually directed Genoese affairs; but
dependence on the will and favour of individuals did
not seem to Charles either a dignified or durable means
of power. The conspiracy of Fieschi had been crushed;
but it had left discontents behind it and a new outbreak
was possible at every hour. Besides, Charles
thirsted to be complete master of a city which was in
his view, and in fact, the connecting link between the
kingdoms of Spain and his Lombard provinces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>Figuerroa, knowing the wishes of his master, opened
his views to the old nobles who were his intimates and
drew them over to his wishes. He terrified them by
setting forth the prospect of new conspiracies and the
popular affection for Gianluigi which was still strong
in the city. He told them that Andrea was too
decrepit to combat these approaching perils and that
prudence counselled adequate provisions to suppress
revolt. Figuerroa found in the minds of the old
nobles, morbidly sensitive to the least breath of popular
commotion, complacent acquiescence, and he induced
some of the faction of San Luca to address a petition
to the emperor in Germany, in which they exaggerated
the Fieschi movement, showed the uncertain faith of
many of the Italian princes and the danger of general
revolt and concluded by requesting that the security
of Genoa be provided for by a Spanish garrison and a
more stable form of government.</p>

<p>The emperor answered the appeal by sending Nicolò
Perenoto, lord of Granveille and imperial councillor,
with some engineers, to construct a fortress on the hill
of Pietra Minuta as a rein on the Genoese populace.
This fortification garrisoned by a strong Spanish force
would have secured the imperial power and stifled all
attempts at revolution. But Andrea, who wished to
rule Genoa himself, vehemently opposed the erection
of a fortress to be occupied by imperial troops. The
prince desired to be the sole imperial representative in
Genoa and to keep the Spanish crown in a state of
dependence upon his loyalty. He therefore resisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
the innovation with all his power, and boldly told
Granveille that he must lay aside the project. When
the imperial minister informed him of the petition sent
by the Genoese nobility to the emperor, the old man
called to him the persons chiefly concerned in that
business, reproached them spiritedly for the weakness
they had shown in falling into an imperial trap, and
induced them to recant their approval of this scheme
of national humiliation.</p>

<p>But Granveille still hoped to win Doria’s consent to
the wishes of the emperor, and he frequently sent his
engineers to Pietra Minuta for the purpose of defining
the position of the new citadel. The people saw these
surveys, and they one day broke into tumult, rushed
to the place and would have killed Granveille and his
engineers if the senate had not forseen the danger and
stationed troops so as to prevent access to the hill.
The emperor was now convinced that he could only
carry out his plans by an open war both with Andrea
and the people; and he therefore wrote to the prince
that he would renounce a project which seemed so
distasteful to his admiral.</p>

<p>Doria on his side pledged himself to reform the
government and give it such a direction as to put it
out of the power of a few persons to reëstablish the
popular constitution. He accordingly instituted the
provision called <i>Garibetto</i> which entirely excluded
popular families from political power and gave rise to
many civil disorders and finally to intestine war. It
completed the alienation of the masses from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
nobility and destroyed the vital force of the Republic.
But the plebeians, the more they were depressed, burned
the more for liberty. The spirit of revolution sometimes
slumbered but was never entirely extinguished.
The opposition of Doria and the threatening attitude
of the populace deterred the Spaniards and the greater
part of the old nobles from carrying out their scheme
of building a fortress to overawe the people. But
though Charles bent to the will of our people in that
project, he secured through the prince a more oligarchic
form of government and removed the new nobles from
power. This success and the increasing subservience
of Doria inspired Charles with new hope that he might
get Genoa entirely in his power as a first step to the
complete control of the Peninsula. He renewed his
efforts with more shrewdness and contrived a scheme
for taking the populace by surprise and lulling to sleep
the vigilance of the old admiral.</p>

<p>A conference was held in Piacenza by the Duke of
Alba, Gonzaga, an envoy of Cosimo, and Tomaso
de’ Marini a Genoese knight. It was agreed that when
Doria had sailed to Spain, to escort the Archduke
Maximilian, Gonzaga should enter the city with a
large body of imperial troops and Cosimo should
support the movement with some regiments of infantry.
The pretext for this military concentration was afforded
by the fact that the Prince Don Phillip, called into
Germany by his father, would return with Doria to
Genoa and Cosimo and Gonzaga would go thither to
pay him homage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>Having made these arrangements, the Duke of Alba
sailed with Doria for Spain (July, 1548) in order to
prepare other parts of the conspiracy. But the Genoese
fortunately received information of the plot. The
Pope, who, since the death of his son, distrusted the
emperor more than ever, having heard of the conference
in Piacenza, instructed Carlo Orsino, governor of
Piacenza, to ascertain what had been done by the conspirators.
Orsino laboured so well that he penetrated
the mystery. Some incautious words of Gonzaga put
him on the scent of the movement and enabled him to
inform the Pope of the nature of the emperor’s plans.
Paul communicated this intelligence to Leonardo
Strata, a Genoese noble living in Rome, and Strata
immediately wrote to the senate. The scheme was so
bold and unexpected that the senators were at first
disposed to distrust the report. But their doubts were
soon removed. Gonzaga soon after sent a messenger
to notify the government that Don Phillip would soon
arrive in Genoa, and to ask quarters in the city for
two thousand cavalry and as many arquebusiers. At
the same time, Cosimo wrote asking permission to pay
homage to the prince in Genoa and to bring as an
escort, to protect him against the plots of Genoese
exiles, two regiments of cavalry and two of infantry.
Andrea also wrote from Rosas (October 19th, 1548) a
letter to the Doge, which, as an eloquent proof of his
servility to Spain, we give entire:&mdash;</p>

<p>“I send with this galley Don Michele de Velasco
and with him three quarter-masters whom His Highness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the prince desires to have forwarded in advance of
himself, for reasons which you will more fully learn
from his ambassador, Figuerroa. Their mission as you
will learn is to prepare lodgings for this court. It
seems expedient for me to write you these few words,
as a citizen, praying you to give me pleasure by
issuing orders that these quarter-masters be allowed to
accompany Don Michele, and assigning them without
delay all the lodgings which may be necessary.</p>

<p>“Receive them with such marks of esteem as you are
accustomed to give when the honour of princes and
the glory of the city are concerned, in order that His
Majesty and this Illustrious Prince, his son, may know
that, not only in this, but in matters of much greater
moment, you are delighted to render him service. For,
besides the general repute which your excellencies will
gain by such a course of conduct, the favour of His
Majesty and His Highness will be much greater
towards you, and their love for the Republic will be
increased so that they will the more cheerfully aid her
in the hour of need, as hitherto. Your Excellencies
should remember that we have no other light or
support but the great goodness of His Majesty which
permits us to live within his kingdoms without any
sense of subjection, and that for this reason alone the
whole city ought to do spontaneously whatever is
required in these circumstances, and all the more that
in these matters which require small sacrifices we shall
gain large favour and induce His Majesty to grant us
privileges of greater importance. I know well that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
our citizens will interpose obstacles as they are
accustomed to do in such emergencies; but your
Excellencies, knowing the convenience and importance
of the matter, will strive to remove all difficulties,
compel all to preserve order and obedience and punish
whoever makes opposition in such a way as to render
them a warning and example to all the rest. I have
nothing more to add on this subject; for I am sure
that you, as wise men, will carefully reflect on the
duty we owe the emperor, and voluntarily and cheerfully
give those orders that are required; the more
that the stay of the prince will be only for a few days,
and small as the favour will be, His Majesty will
reckon it a great one and always remember your good
will and that of the city towards Himself. His
Highness will also be gratified for your prompt good
service and all his suite will leave you greatly pleased
by your hospitality. M. Domenico Doria, the bearer
of this letter, will speak more fully of this concernment
to your Excellencies, to whom I commend me with
affectionate solicitude.”</p>

<p>These simultaneous requests removed the doubts of
the senators. They showed an admirable firmness in
refusing quarters for the soldiers of Gonzaga and
Medici. Gonzaga renewed his request and the senate
replied that if he appeared at the gates with more
than twenty horses he would find them shut in his
face. He came with three hundred infantry and two
companies of cavalry, but he was obliged to quarter
himself outside of the walls, in Sestri. Cosimo, seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the firmness of the senate, relinquished the design of
coming. But no one dared resist Doria, and his
Spaniards were received in the city.</p>

<p>While these events were transpiring Don Phillip
sailed out of Spain with a fleet of fifty-eight galleys,
of which nineteen belonged to Prince Doria and six to
Antonio Doria, two to the prince of Monaco and two
to Visconte Cicala. There were forty other vessels of
which six were Genoese. Don Phillip took passage on
board the admiral’s galley, a vessel wonderful for her
size, construction and equipment. The designs of the
embellishments were made by Pierino del Vaga, and
executed by Carota and Tasso, Florentine artists. The
standards were painted by Vaga. The gilding, the
satins and the rich brocades rendered the vessel a
marvel of beauty. The young prince, astonished by
this magnificence, was prodigal of honours and marks
of affection to Andrea, hoping to captivate the old man
and secure his coöperation in the plot against the
Republic. As they neared our coasts, Phillip inquired
of the admiral where he would be quartered in Genoa.
The admiral responded that he hoped to have that
honour for his palace in Fassiolo, where the emperor
had been his guest. The young Prince showed
dissatisfaction at the response and rejoined that he
wished to reside in the Ducal palace. “That,” replied
Andrea “Is not in my power. Your Highness may ask
it of the senate, though I am of opinion that those who
live there will not willingly evacuate it.” These frank
words enraged Phillip, and his wrath was yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
inflamed immediately after by letters of Gonzaga which
reported that their plan could not be put into execution.
The young prince broke out into angry imprecations;
but his preceptor, the Duke of Alba conjured him to
conceal his displeasure lest the suspicions of the
Genoese should be increased, and Phillip constrained
himself to a complacent reception of the messengers of
the Republic.</p>

<p>He landed at Savona and was entertained by
Benedetta Spinola, a beautiful and courteous widow.
After a brief stay he proceeded to Genoa. The princess
Peretta received him in the Doria palace with the
highest honour. The Doge and the senators, the
Genoese cardinals Doria and Cybo, Lord Bishop Matera,
envoy of the Pope, and the ministers of other nations
went to pay him homage.</p>

<p>We shall not dwell on the sumptuous reception of
Phillip by the nobility, or the splendour which Doria
displayed with his open court and princely banquets
for the Spanish barons. The luxury of the decorations,
the richness of the furniture, the splendour of the
carpets and service of every kind and the wealth sunk
in the banquets of that palace were then the marvel of
Italy. Don Phillip and his suite were filled with
admiration by the magnificence of their reception.</p>

<p>The Genoese populace did not participate in these
festivities. They could ill brook these servile attentions
towards those who were conspiring, not merely to
deprive them of political power, but to take away the
independence of the Republic; and, looking on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
ill-concealed rage, they were more than once on the
brink of revolution. On the 3rd of December at
midnight, the people rose at the cry of “<i>Ammazza,
Ammazza</i>”&mdash;kill them, kill them&mdash;and rushed to attack
fifty of the <i>Bisogni</i> who were in a tavern of the mole;
and they would have despatched the Spaniards, if
Colonel Spinola had not arrived on the ground with a
strong body of infantry in time to quell the tumult.
But the rage of the populace continued. Don Phillip
had requested the city police to arrest a certain Don
Antonio d’Arze, a Spaniard guilty of homicide. After
the arrest, he sent eighty Spanish arquebusiers to
conduct the criminal from the prison on board a galley.
Near the Ducal palace, this body of Spaniards met the
city guard. The <i>Bisogni</i> had their matches lit, and
the guard, believing that the imperial troops came
to assault the palace, prepared to make a desperate
resistance, and in fact drove the Spaniards back by
force. Many of the latter were wounded and some lost
their lives. In a twinkling, the rumour ran that the
Spaniards had attacked the Ducal palace; the people
collected in crowds and would have put the Spaniards
to the edge of the sword if the Doge and two governors
of the palace had not mingled in the crowd and soothed
the irritation. Prince Doria himself was carried in a
palanquin through the most populous quarters, and
besought the people to lay aside their hostile intentions.
The populace was held in subjection by force and
supplications; but the Spaniards lost no time in returning
on board their ships, and Don Phillip departed
dissimulating his animosity against the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>We must here speak of an incident which occurred
while Don Phillip was the guest of the city; though
Bandello places it some years earlier.</p>

<p>In one of the many descents of the Turkish corsair
upon the Riviera, they had captured a Genoese girl
about ten years of age, belonging, says the chronicle,
to the illustrious family of the Calvi. Being of remarkable
beauty she was sold by the pirates at a high
price to a merchant who carried her into Spain. Here
she grew more beautiful with years and inspired a son
of the Duke of Alba with an ardent passion which he
found means to satisfy. When Don Phillip came into
Italy, the young man was obliged to accompany the
cortège; but not wishing to leave the young woman,
he took her on board one of the vessels and brought
her to Genoa. Annina had never forgotten her parents
and her native city; and as soon as she landed, she
induced her pages by rich presents to find her lodgings
on the piazza Maruffi, near the palace of Stefano
Fieschi and in the residence of the Calvi. Annina
entered her father’s house with joy, and, seizing a
moment when her lover was occupied with Don Phillip,
she dismissed her domestics and revealed herself to
her parents. The embracings, the tears, the transports
of tenderness, cannot be described. But the noble girl
broke off these demonstrations of affection. “It is
time that I think of my liberation. Though loaded
with ornaments, I have been hitherto only a slave, and
I owe it to my dignity and my blood to atone in the
shadow of the altar for my dishonourable though forced
manner of life. Take me to a convent before my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
master learns that I belong to you, and put me in a
cell where none may ever hear my name pronounced.”
Her parents approved her choice and at once sent her
to a monastery near the city, where she was received
under another name. She had scarcely departed when
the knight came to find his mistress, and, inquiring for
her, he read in the silence of the pages that she had
fled. He was at the first moment about to wreak his
anger on these servants; but he restrained himself and
demanded of the Calvi the restoration of the girl. An
angry contention arose which raised a tumult in that
part of the city. In a few moments the piazza was
full of men of both nations. Among the first to enter
the house of Calvi to succour the Genoese was Giovanni
Lavagna, allied by blood to the Fieschi. He was one
of the most reckless warriors of his time. Encountering
the Spanish knight at the head of the staircase surrounded
by armed men and threatening the bystanders,
he demanded the cause of his discourteous manners.
Alba replied:&mdash;</p>

<p>“It does not concern thee, white moor and traitor
that thou art!”</p>

<p>Lavagna was not accustomed to receive abuse with
patience, and he angrily retorted:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Moorish Jew, thou liest in the throat!” and drawing
his sword, threw himself upon the Spaniard. The
fight was of brief duration. Despite the assistance of
his companions, the knight was pierced to the heart.
The Spaniards descended into the piazza and came to
blows with the populace, who killed some and put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
others to flight. Lavagna fearing the vengeance of
Phillip took refuge in the province of Piacenza.</p>

<p>Don Phillip did not relinquish the hope of reducing
Genoa to the condition of a province, and he was
encouraged by Gonzaga, Figuerroa and the Duke of
Alba. The plan of the new fortress was again taken
up. The partisans of Spain reasoned that the popular
hostility to Spain constantly threatened the city with
revolution and that so stubborn a people needed a
strong rein. It was reasonable enough they said that
Doria, when he was in the full vigour of life, should
have opposed the erection of the citadel, but now when
he was old and infirm almost to decrepitude he ought
no longer to resist the will of Cæsar.</p>

<p>Charles sent to Genoa a certain Sigismondi Fransino
with instructions to confer with Doria and Centurione
and endeavour to gain their consent to the fortification.
Some engineers also came secretly, for the purpose of
selecting the most convenient site. They renounced
the plan of fortifying Pietra Minuta and recommended
that the fortress of Castelletto should be restored.
Doria hearing of this new plan and wishing to finish
once for all with these projects for the humiliation
of Genoa, sent Adamo Centurione into Flanders to
confer with Cæsar and convince him that there was
imminent peril of losing the Republic altogether
unless these schemes were renounced. Charles made
the most formal pledges that he would put a stop to
the intrigue and never again raise the question. The
advice of Don Bernardino Mendozza probably had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
more weight with Charles than the remonstrances of
Centurione. Mendozza was a man of infinite cunning
and dexterity in politics. He pointed out to his
sovereign the excessive devotion of the Genoese to the
acquisition of wealth, and advised him to employ every
artifice to get their money into the imperial treasury
in the form of loans secured upon lands, privileges,
feuds and jurisdictions in Sicily, Naples and Spain.
“Thus,” said the adroit politician, “you will bind the
Genoese to the fortunes of your kingdom by a voluntary
chain; since when their riches are in your hands
they will be naturally inclined to increase and maintain
your power. This hold upon their affections will be
worth more than any fortress.”</p>

<p>This shrewd advice was followed; every inducement
was held out to the wealthy nobles to place their
money in the hands of the emperor, with such securities
and guarantees as would infallibly induce other
citizens to follow the example and bind themselves
with their fortunes to Spain. By this expedient
Charles seemed to leave the Genoese their independence,
but he really made them tributary to his crown,
Phillip II. pursued this policy with even greater assiduity
and it became hereditary in the Spanish princes.
It was in fact for two centuries the political science by
which the court of Spain regulated the affairs of Italy;
and the people found themselves insensibly bound,
without their own action, to the interests and policy of
that crown. It must be said that some give a different
version of the affair of the citadel. Writers of weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
tell us that, even in this, Doria was subservient to
Charles; but we cannot believe it possible. His steadfast
resistance to that scheme is more consistent with
the greatness and fame of the illustrious admiral; and,
though he was a vehement partisan of the imperial
cause, he could not have wished to become, like Cosimo,
its slave. When the Medici gave up to imperial troops
the fortresses of Florence and Leghorn, he found himself
in the hands of a master, and never digested the
retort of Venice, who refused to treat with him
“because he was, in his own house, the servant of
another man.”</p>

<p>We think the truth to be that when Doria saw the
unanimity of the people in opposing the erection of a
citadel, he wisely resolved to support his fellow-citizens,
and the people are entitled to the chief praise for the
failure of that scheme. They were not yet corrupted
by the servility of the nobility, and might have
renewed the examples of their ancient valour and
prevented the foreign power from striking root in the
Republic. They lost no opportunity of manifesting
their profound dislike of Spain, as Doge Lercaro
himself testifies. When Charles gave to Cosimo the
government of Piombino, then in the hands of the
Appiani, the Genoese rose up in arms and demanded of
the senate that galleys be despatched to Elba to expel
the Florentines and Spaniards. This time, too, it was
Doria who held back the arms of the people.</p>

<p>It is easy to see that the new ties between Genoa
and Spain were the principal occasion of our decline.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Doria, by breaking the French alliance and persecuting
the men of Barbary (instead of courting their alliance
after the example of Venice) hastened our fall. Our
commerce gradually declined. French and Barbary
fleets roved over our seas and destroyed our marine.
The city was put to great straits, and longed in vain
for the only remedy for its maladies, the alliance of
France to open up the commerce of the East. Fieschi,
who had courted these benefits, was remembered the
more sadly as disasters multiplied upon the Republic.</p>

<p>The government comprehended that some important
and energetic measures must be taken to restore our
fortunes; and, after mature reflection, the senate resolved
to attempt the recovery of our Eastern trade.
The only remnant of our extensive possessions in the
Levant was the island of Scio, which was still held by
the family of the Giustiniani. In 1558, Giovanni
Di Franchi and Nicolò Grillo were sent to Constantinople,
with eight vessels bearing costly presents for
the Sultan and his principal ministers, to ask a renewal
of trade and treaties of amity and commerce such as
the Porte maintained with the Venitians.</p>

<p>The Porte was disposed to accept our trade and
friendship, but the king of France raised objections
which destroyed the hopes of Genoa. He showed the
Porte that the Genoese were the fast allies of Spain,
and could not remain neutral between Spaniards and
Turks; that all the maritime enterprises of Charles to
the damage of the Turks had been conducted with
Genoese fleets; that Doria the greatest of the enemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
of Turkey and the admiral of Spain, lived in Genoa
and ruled it at his caprice; that, in fine, the Porte
could not safely listen to the proposals of the Genoese
unless they declared themselves enemies of Spain.
These arguments changed the purpose of Soliman, and
he sent the Ligurian ambassadors home without giving
them audience. The Republic lost hope of reacquiring
that commerce with the East which had once enabled
it to triumph over Pisa and Venice.</p>

<p>Such were the consequences of our fatal bondage to
the empire. The people, guided by infallible instincts,
showed in this matter more wisdom than their rulers.
If we had shaken off the imperial embraces, we might
have obtained from the Turks all those privileges which
the Venitians had acquired a few years before; nor
should we have had rivals to contest our gains. The
French were falling into civil commotions which turned
their attention from commercial enterprises. The
English seldom showed themselves in our seas. The
Dutch had not yet thrown off the yoke at which they
were fretting, and the Venitians soon after, becoming
as inimical as the Spaniards to the Turkish power, were
excluded from Eastern markets. The Levant, still
rich in silk fabrics, might have been a fountain of vast
wealth for Genoese merchants.</p>

<p class="pch">PRINCE GIULIO CYBO.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">Andrea</span> Doria had finally extinguished in Genoa the
popular conspiracies for liberty, and on the ruins of the
Guelph Fieschi house had firmly planted the Spanish
tyranny. Still, in every corner of the Peninsula, the
people, not yet corrupted by the servility of the great,
cherished the memory of better days, and scarcely
concealed their antipathy to Spain. The sword of
Doria&mdash;which is still sacriligiously suspended over the
high altar of the church of San Matteo&mdash;was once more
stained with the blood of the people.</p>

<p>Don Pietro di Toledo, a man of integrity, but
haughty and devoted to Rome, was very solicitous to
introduce the Spanish inquisition into Naples in order
to wash out in blood the stains of heresy. Orchine da
Siena, Lorenzo Romano, Montalcino and Vermiglio
were preaching the doctrines of Luther and Zuingle
and secretly diffusing the works of Melancthon and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Erasmus. The people learned the intentions of Toledo,
and rose almost to a man, protesting against inquisitors
and martyrdoms. Their protests yielded no
fruit and they seized their arms, deposed the foreign
governors and created new magistrates, promising,
however, to maintain their devotion to the empire.
Toledo issued a proclamation that he would proceed to
the trial and punishment of Tommaso Aniello of
Sorrento and Cesare Mormile, who were reputed the
leaders of the sedition. The two rebels came before
the judges with such a mass of followers, that the court
counted it better policy to honour rather than punish
them. But the viceroy, determined to terrify Naples,
barbarously butchered Gianluigi Capuano, Fabrizio
d’Alessandro and Antonio Villamarino, and threatened
capital punishment against any who should remove the
bloody corpses.</p>

<p>This exasperated but did not awe the populace.
They made common cause with the barons, sent deputies
to the emperor and signed a truce with Toledo
until the imperial answer should be known. The truce
was worse than war. The <i>Bisogni</i>, who had taken
refuge in the castles, not only destroyed the surrounding
houses, but in their frequent sorties killed all who fell
into their hands, and the populace retorted by killing
the Spanish prisoners whom they had captured.</p>

<p>Toledo saw that he was too weak to make head
against the enraged populace, who were already investing
the forts and citadels held by his troops, and
sent for Doria to deliver him from his embarrassment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
Andrea was ill prepared for so grave an undertaking.
His galleys were damaged and without crews; for
besides the Barbary slaves who fled in that fatal night
of the Fieschi, the convicts had first sacked the ships
and then taken refuge in the Apennines. But the
admiral entered on the project of aiding Toledo with
unwonted zeal. He obtained money from Prince
Centurione, enlisted new crews and officers, and soon
had a fleet ready to sail. The galleys were sent off
under his lieutenants Marco Centurione, son of Adamo,
and Antonio Doria. Thanks to these ships of Doria,
Toledo suppressed the revolt in Naples, took capital
vengeance on the leaders and punished the people with
heavy taxation. Yet it has been said that the emperor
<i>pardoned</i> the rebels! History spoke falsehood. Still,
this stormy protest of the people saved Naples from
the inquisition. The masses well knew the real object
of Toledo. He sought less to crush heresy than to
exterminate the spirit of liberty.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans were a few years later silent
witnesses of fierce religious persecution. The inquisition
employed such zeal, that to mention Montalto
alone, two thousand persons were butchered and nearly
an equal number condemned to death in eleven days.
Tradition says that the executioner cut them down in
the streets, like so many goats. While, through the
assistance of Doria, the Spanish power took firm root
in Italy and crushed the spirit of popular liberty, (I
hope that none will believe my respect for the truth
dictated by antipathy towards the great admiral) not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
a few daring spirits still struggled to emancipate the
nation and to destroy the prop on which the emperor
leaned. The times were sanguinary; blood was
washed out with blood. The partisans of Fieschi
raging for vengeance often attempted to assassinate
Andrea; and the obstacles in their way only increased
their fury. In August, 1547, four men of Valditaro,
to whom Galeotto of Mirandola added eight of his
bandits, were sent to Genoa for the purpose of assassinating
Doria while he should be coming out of his
palace. It was intended that a conspiracy organized
in the city should seize the moment for proclaiming a
popular government and maintaining it by force of
arms. Galeotto promised to lead the enterprise in
person. He was a terrible man, and his partisans
believed that no enterprise could miscarry which had
at its head so practiced a conspirator and assassin.
The histories relate of him that when the Count Gianfrancesco,
a literary man of note, had been restored to
the government of Mirandola by the officers of Julius
II., Galeotto, in a night of October, 1533, scaled the
fortress with forty companions, killed the count who
was kneeling before the crucifix, his uncle and his son
Alberto, and then shutting up the dependents of the
count in the prison of the fortress took possession of
the government of Mirandola. Charles V. condemned
him to death for this horrid crime; but Galeotto
defended himself alike against the arms and the
treachery of Leyva, and finally surrendered the castle
to Henry of France for a large compensation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>

<p>With such men, the conspiracy did not seem likely
to fail of its principal object. However, the assassins
could not find in Genoa safe hiding for studying the
habits of Andrea. Besides, the cunning old man was
on the alert for such plots, and never left his house
except under a strong escort of his faithful dependents.
The assassins found it necessary to save their own lives
by a precipitate flight.</p>

<p>A second attempt at his assassination came to the
knowledge of Doria. Cornelio Bentivoglio, aided by
the exiles, especially the Fieschi, armed a galley with
two hundred men and all necessary equipments, with
the design of entering the port by night and attacking
the palace of Doria. At the same time the exiles
assisted by Pier Luigi Farnese were expected to attack
the city on the East side. On this occasion, also, the
leader had a reputation which promised success. Bentivoglio
was an audacious and fierce young man, who,
having been expelled from the government of Bologna
by his father Costanzo, entered the military service of
France and obtained considerable repute in the art of
war. Perhaps the prince would have fallen under this
conspiracy, if his own counterplot against the Duke of
Piacenza had not broken up the plans of Bentivoglio.</p>

<p>But the Fieschi party did not lay down their arms
or relinquish their hopes of vengeance. They enlisted
Prince Giulio Cybo among others in their cause. This
nobleman having taken up and continued the conspiracy
of Fieschi, to whom he was allied, deserves a
place in our history. The arms of Cybo and Fieschi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
were the same; the former used more unworthy means
than the latter, but both ended their lives in misfortune
consecrated by patriotism.</p>

<p>The family of the Cybo was of very ancient, perhaps
of, Byzantine origin. They possessed in the tenth
century islands and walled towns. In 1188, Ermes
Cybo subscribed the treaty of peace between the Pisans
and Ligurians. We find in old manuscripts that, in
1261, they had palaces in the via del Campo. A
Guglielmo Cybo, who died in 1311, built the magnificent
church of St. Francis in Casteletto and there was
erected the marble sepulchre of himself and his family.
This Guglielmo rendered important services to the
Republic for which he obtained the privilege of adding
to his arms the device of the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The family
produced many other distinguished men, among whom
may be mentioned Innocent VIII. In his youth, this
pontiff became the father of a son named Francesco
who was governor of Rome during the pontificate of
Innocent and married Maddalena de’ Medici sister of
Leo X. In the year 1500, Lorenzo Cybo was born
of this marriage in St. Pierdarena, a suburb of Genoa.
Lorenzo devoted himself to arms, and in the Milan
war, carried the fortress of Monza by assault. The
cardinal Innocent Cybo, his elder brother, ceded him
the county of Ferentillo and he also governed Vetralla,
Giano and Montegiove. Desirous of enlarging his
estates, he married Ricciarda daughter and heiress of
Alberico Malaspina, Marquis of Massa and Carrara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and widow of Count Scipione Fieschi who died in
1520.</p>

<p>Ricciarda bore Lorenzo several children, one of whom
was Eleonora wife of Gianluigi Fieschi. There were
besides, Isabella, who married Vitaliano Visconti Borromeo,
Giulio and Alberico. Giulio, whose career we
shall briefly recount, was born in Rome in 1525, and
was educated in the court of Charles V. where the
beauty of his person and the sprightliness of his intellect
acquired him the admiration of the Spanish courtiers.</p>

<p>The mother of Giulio, who was in possession of Massa
and Carrara, formed the resolution of transferring the
feud to the younger brother, Alberico. Giulio went to
Rome and in vain employed entreaty and threats to
change her purpose. He then resolved to take by force
of arms a property which he believed his own. In
1545, when Ricciarda and Cardinal Cybo were in
Carrara, he attacked the castle of that place at the
head of fifty men and endeavoured to capture his
mother. She fled into the tower and foiled his design.
She punished with severity some vassals who had aided
Giulio, and returned to Rome where she ceded the feud
to Alberico. This increased the exasperation of Giulio
who renewed his hostile purposes with greater energy.
Cosimo furnished him some peasant bands of Pietrasanta,
and Gianettino Doria supported him with his
fleet. In September, 1546, the disinherited count
appeared before Massa with one thousand infantry and
one hundred cavalry. His partisans in the town,
especially the brothers Moretto and Bernardino Venturini,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
seized the gate of St. Giacomo and opened it to
Giulio, who was recognized by the people as their
rightful master. The fortress was still held by Pietro
Gassani; but Gianettino Doria arrived with his galleys,
landed artillery and forced him to surrender to Paolo
di Castello. The fortresses of Moneta and Lavenza
were also given up to the partisans of Giulio, who,
grateful for the assistance of Gianettino, espoused his
sister Peretta. But his reign was of short duration.
Ricciarda appealed to Charles V., who ordered Gonzaga
to have the fortress consigned to Cardinal Cybo.
Giulio refused, Cosimo turned against him, captured
him at Agnano, and the young count did not obtain
his liberty until he had ceded the castle (8th March,
1547) which was occupied by Spanish troops until
Ricciarda returned to it two years later.</p>

<p>It is probable that Giulio had at this time some
intrigues with the French court. The emperor had
declared against him, and he was desirous of obtaining
the support of France by ceding the fortress of Massa.
The partisans of Spain were alarmed at the prospect
of having a French garrison so near to Genoa, and
Andrea Doria assisted in forcing Giulio to relinquish
his hold on his father’s domains.</p>

<p>The young count, full of bitterness for the treatment
he had received, went to Gonzaga in Piacenza (the
latter was called to Piacenza by the assassination of
Pier Luigi Farnese) and remonstrated against being
deprived of his inheritance. He received no encouragement
from Spain, who refused to restore the Castle of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Massa, and went to Parma and conferred with Ottavio
Farnese who was also soured against the imperial
agents for old and new acts of hostility. He then
returned to Rome and negotiated with his mother,
who agreed to recognize him as Lord of Massa and
Carrara for forty thousand gold crowns of the sun.
He borrowed twenty thousand gold crowns upon
interest, and pledged the twenty thousand crowns of
the dower of Peretta for the rest. He applied to
Andrea Doria for the dower of his wife; but the prince,
having suspicions of Giulio’s complicity with Fieschi,
refused to pay over the money and neither personal
entreaty nor the influence of friends could induce the
prince to satisfy the just demands of Giulio and Peretta.
He alleged that the damages he had suffered in the
Fieschi sedition had rendered it impossible for him to
pay so considerable a sum, and wished to charge Giulio
with the expenses of Gianettino’s expedition of Massa.</p>

<p>The chronicle of Venturini, which we consult, disproves
the statements of those who wrote history
without the aid of documents, and renders it clear that
Andrea debited Cybo with all the expenses incurred
while the galleys lay on the coast of Massa, of which
he had preserved a minute account rather as a merchant
and usurer than as a Prince.</p>

<p>Cybo was thus deprived of the means of satisfying
his mother and recovering his paternal inheritance;
and he conspired with the king of France, Duke
Ottavio and Signor Mortier to deal a great blow against
the Spanish power, beginningwith Genoa where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
Dorias constituted the prop of Spain. He held many
consultations with the Cardinal of Belais, the exiles
Cornelio Fieschi, Paolo Spinola and others. The confederates
fixed on the following plan:&mdash;The movement
should be begun in Genoa where the Fieschi had warm
friends and the Spaniards were detested. Ottobuono
Fieschi, who though living in Venice had devoted
dependents, should furnish five hundred infantry and
Spinola should introduce into the city and conceal in
his house one hundred men of the valleys; Giulio
would send from Massa upon barks a body of men
ostensibly to be enrolled at Milan in the imperial
regiment which he commanded. They believed that
Doria would have no suspicion on account of the close
alliance of Cybo with his family, and that all obstacles
would be easily overcome. Some persons were placed
by intrigue in the service of Andrea and Centurione,
with instructions to assassinate them at a preconcerted
signal. It was believed that the death of those two
and a few other partisans of Spain would open an easy
path to the overthrow of the imperial power in Genoa.</p>

<p>Venice was at that period the asylum of all those
patriots whom domestic and foreign tyranny had driven
into exile. In the shadow of the lion of St. Mark,
Donato Gianotti wrote his weighty prose and that
wonderful discourse to Paul III. of which we have
spoken. There lived Carnesecchi, Gino Capponi, Vico
de’ Nobili, the Strozzi, Varchi, the good Nardi and
Lorenzino de’ Medici. The latter meditated there that
defence of his which has no comparison in our literature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
Bartolomeo Cavalcanti, a man of great talents and
eloquence, disgusted with the government of Cosimo,
had voluntarily joined the exiles. There were also
many Genoese who had been expelled from home for
complicity with party broils. Thither went Cybo,
Gaspare Venturini, Paolo Spinola and captain Alessandro
Tomasi of Siena, captain Paolo da Castiglione,
who was to have been of the party, pretended to be ill
at the moment of setting out and remained in Rome
to betray the conspirators to the ministers of Spain.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, Cybo collected his partisans in
the house of Gaspare Fiesco-Botto. There were present
besides the exiles already mentioned, the Fieschi
brothers, Ottaviano Zino and Count Galeotto di Mirandola.
Cybo spoke warmly of the revolution which he
was planning. He declared that he wished to free the
country from the yoke of Spain and restore to its bosom
the virtuous exiles whom he saw around him, whose
only crime was an ardent love of country. He desired
to continue the revolution begun by his unfortunate
friend and relative the Count Gianluigi, and to avenge
his untimely fate. Fortune had crushed that rising
too soon to permit him to reënforce Fieschi with the
troops he had collected at Borghetto and ordered to
move on Genoa. He had afterwards pretended to
support the Doria party only from motives of convenience.
But he would now throw aside the mask
and proclaim them to be traitors who had bound the
Republic and delivered her to the Spanish tyranny.
Everything promised success to the new rising; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
arms were collected, all hearts burning for action and
the Dorias unprepared to encounter the popular storm.
Cæsar himself was in no condition to resist the sudden
uprising of an indignant people, leagued to sweep Italy
clean of his barbarian hordes. The exiles were greatly
moved by these bold words, and swore to participate
in the struggle for emancipation. But Cosimo was
watching Giulio; and Gonzaga and Doria, to whom
Castiglione had revealed everything, had their eyes on
all the conspirators. The informer paid dearly for his
treachery. Venturini tells us that he himself (perhaps
with the connivance of Prince Alberico) killed the
traitor with his own hand.</p>

<p>The conspirators, true to their promises, abandoned
hospitable Venice and went to the posts assigned them
by Cybo. Ottaviano Zino returned to Genoa, and,
while studying to seem idle, laboured incessantly to
prepare the populace for revolt. Paolo Spinola was
sent to Garfagnana, once subject to the Fieschi, where
he hoped to find ardent partisans. Others on similar
missions travelled to other places. Cybo, who had
supreme command, obtained through the aid of Montachino
a dependent of Scipione Fieschi, three thousand
gold crowns. The French agents gave him countersigns
for the Governor of Mondovi, Candele, who was
instructed to support the movement with two thousand
infantry. He then travelled through Ferrara and
Parma to Pontremoli. The governor of that feud,
Pietro Dureta, encountered him at the ford of the
Magra and attacked him. Cybo drew his sword and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
raised the cry of <i>Gatto</i> hoping to raise the vassals of
Fieschi; but he was struck in the head by a halberd,
received a wound in his right hand and fell lifeless to
the ground. He was sent to Milan under a strong
guard and Nicolò Secco was appointed to prepare the
process against him. The letters of the Fieschi which
were found on his person left no room to doubt his
guilt. Some tell us that he was several times tortured
and confessed that Farnese, Maffei, Ghisa and the Pope
himself were accomplices in the plot, and that the
Fieschi and Farnese were its instigators. The emperor
did not wish to execute Cybo; and we find evidence
in documents of the period that even the bloodthirsty
Gonzaga made every exertion to save him. On the
other hand Graneville and Doria laboured with all their
power to secure his punishment. In fact, so soon as
Doria heard of this plot, committed rather in intention
than act and excusable by the youth of the conspirator,
“the prince (I use the words of Porzio) inflamed to
wrath by the offence and full of vengeful animosity,
disregarded the double tie which bound him to the
young man, and made incessant appeals to Cæsar for
the blood of his relative.”</p>

<p>Many Italian and foreign princes asked grace for
the prisoner, and the emperor was at first undecided;
but severity triumphed over mercy&mdash;Doria desired
vengeance and he obtained it. The victim met his fate
with manly intrepidity. He was beheaded and his
body exposed between two wax candles in the public
square. Nearly all the historians are in error regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the time of his execution. The chronicle of Venturini
declares that it occurred on the 18th of May, 1548.
He was scarcely twenty years of age. Porzio says:&mdash;“His
courage and military capacity inspired all who
knew him with the conviction that, if he had not
perished in boyhood, he would have become one of
the first captains of his age. He made a single
mistake: that of endeavouring to expel one foreigner
with another&mdash;to drive out the Spaniards in order to
establish the French in Italy.”</p>

<p>Zino was not more fortunate in Genoa. His friends
urged him to flee from the city; but he, wrapped in
false security, refused to follow their advice. He was
arrested and his mangled limbs were found one morning
on the piazza of the Ducal palace. Other accomplices
lost their property by confiscation or fell in other
countries under the dagger of assassins employed by
Doria, to whom none could deny the right of inflicting
punishment at his own pleasure. He made free use of
this privilege of his position. It is certain that he was
implicated in the assassination of Luciano Grimaldi,
Lord of Monaco, whom Bartolomeo Doria Marquis
of Dolceacqua killed with thirty-two stabs. Andrea
bequeathed this form of justice to his successor. So
far as we know, no one has ever been able to explain
why Giovanni Andrea Doria imprisoned his secretary
Antonio Ricciardi da Loano, whom Spotorno calls one
of the brightest intellects of Liguria. The unhappy
victim after being buried for a long time in a dungeon,
without being able to soothe his angry master or ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
learn the cause of his punishment, became desperate
and committed suicide by dashing out his brains against
the walls of his cell.</p>

<p>We do not know the fate of Paolo Spinola who was
declared a rebel and fled to Venice. There is in the
Genoese archives a letter from him written the 6th of
April, 1548 to the Genoese government. It paints in
vivid colours the triple slavery of Genoa to Charles V.,
Doria, and the bank of St. George which, having lands
and jurisdiction of a peculiar character, was a state
within the state.</p>

<p>Spinola writes:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your Excellencies having made a public proclamation,
calling upon me to render before you an account
of my conduct within the term of one month under
pain of being declared a rebel, and this proclamation
having only at this moment come to my knowledge, I
am constrained to ask you as just persons&mdash;which I
suppose you to be&mdash;to extend the time and give me
proper space for presenting myself before you, placing
me in fact in the same position I would occupy if the
summons bore the present date. And, as I know that
all cities have malignant citizens and Genoa above all
others, (there being many among you who are opposed
to your peace and liberty) so that poor people are no
longer free except in name and your Excellencies can
give no real security to property and persons, it is
necessary that men ask better guarantees than those
of the government from the persons who are masters
of our liberties. Andrea Doria being the chief of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
our masters, prince both in name and fact, and having
more power than your Excellencies, and I knowing
him to be a mortal enemy of my family, I pray you if
you grant my first prayer to hear also the second,
which is that you furnish me a safe conduct of the said
Andrea Doria promising me freedom from all molestation,
direct or indirect, on his part that of any persons
dependent upon him. Furthermore, for as much as
the emperor, to your shame and mine, takes more
thought for the concerns of your city than for his
subject provinces, being in name our friend but in fact
our master and lord, and since I must pass through his
dominions to reach your city, I also ask the safe
conduct of Don Ferrante, the imperial lieutenant
general in Italy, in the same terms as the former.
Further, having learned that the administration of the
bank of St. George has, contrary to all right and precedent,
added its authority to your summons, I ask
that the said administration send me a safe conduct of
like tenor with the others above requested. So soon
as I receive these several safe conducts, I shall feel
myself secure against the malevolence of individuals,
and will immediately place myself in your hands and
abide your just judgment.”</p>

<p>We have esteemed it our duty to give the letter of
the illustrious exile. We leave comment and criticism
to other pens.</p>

<p>Among those condemned for contumacy to decapitation
and confiscation of goods was Scipione Fieschi.
The sentence pronounced against him gave rise to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
legal cause which has no equal either in its duration
or the fame of the jurists who conducted it. Rolando
a Valle was the advocate of Fieschi, and the claims of
the Republic were maintained by Giovanni Cefalo,
Tiberio Sigiano, Nervio, Menocchio and the college of
Padua. The case was contested with singular pertinacity,
and most princes were interested for one or the
other party.</p>

<p>Scipione after the death of Gianluigi, not being able
to return to Loano which was bequeathed to him by
his father, because the Dorias had seized the feud, took
refuge in Valditaro and there, as we have seen, induced
the people to put themselves into the hands of Pier
Luigi Farnese. He afterwards visited Rome, where
the Pope received him privately and treated him with
great affection. At a subsequent period he was the
guest of Giulio Cybo in Massa and the two were warm
friends.</p>

<p>When Cybo was arrested Scipione saw that it was
necessary that he exculpate himself before Cæsar, and
he asked an imperial audience through Francesco
Barca, but the request was not granted. On the
contrary, when the emperor learned that Scipione was
charged, in the Cybo process, with being one of the
chief accomplices he ordered Suarez, by decree of
March 14th, 1550, to institute proceedings against
him. He was cited to appear in Genoa for trial and
obtained a safe conduct; but afterwards he remembered
the breach of faith with Gerolamo and declined to
appear. The case against him was conducted by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
Giovanni Giacomo Cybo-Peirano, and after the death
of this advocate, it was carried on by his son. Doria
himself employed an advocate to watch the progress
of the trial and hasten its completion. In the meantime
Scipione passed into France and entered the
service of Henry II. He did not however take up a
permanent residence there, the jurists of Padua having
advised him to reside alternately at Rome, Venice and
Mirandola. We know that he was accused of receiving
and favouring exiles from Genoa, of capturing Spanish
ships with his own galleys, of condemning the prisoners
to the oar and plundering the works of art which these
vessels were transporting to the empress Augusta.
The archives of Spain are full of accusations of similar
character; but they are the fictions of informers.</p>

<p>Figuerroa gave his decision on the 28th of January,
1552, but for some reason it was not confirmed by the
emperor, and this gave Scipione strong hopes of being
reinstated in his father’s domains. But Doria and the
Republic employed influences which overcame the
imperial scruples and Ferdinand confirmed the sentence
on the 12th of April, 1559, in such terms as to destroy
all the hopes of Fieschi.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in the treaty of Castel Cambrese,
Phillip II. who had succeeded to the crown of Spain,
stipulated with Henry II. of France, that all those who
had been punished with confiscation for aiding either
crown should be reinstated in their property, particularly
mentioning Ottaviano Fregoso and Count
Scipione and declaring them as fully restored to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
rights as though they were parties to the treaty.
Phillip further pledged himself to secure the restoration
to Scipione of those feuds which had been seized by
the empire or the Republic. The Spanish monarch
issued his decree to the senate of Milan ordering the
surrender of Pontremoli to Fieschi; but it was not
carried into effect. The senate held that the condemnation
was a just punishment for a double treason
committed both by Scipione and his brothers and
refused to obey the imperial decree. The queen of
France who had a high esteem for the young Scipione
interceded for him, and Ferdinand moved by her
powerful entreaties on the 13th of July, 1552, invested
the count with Varese, Montobbio and Roccatagliata;
at the same time he signed some other decrees in his
favour. These various decrees gave rise to the controversy
before the tribunals, with Scipione on one side,
and the Republic and the possessors of the feuds on
the other. The count maintained the nullity of his
condemnation, while the Republic insisted on its
legality and maintained that Scipione had lost all
claims to the property confiscated for his treason, and
that the decrees of the emperor were without force or
validity. Finally, on the 2nd of August, 1574, the
emperor Maximilian gave his decision against the
claims of Scipione and absolved the Republic, Antonio
and Pagano Doria, Ettore Fieschi (of the Savignone
branch) and Count Claudio Landi, who were in
possession of the lands and castles of the Fieschi.</p>

<p>We shall speak of Ottobuono Fieschi in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
place. It is enough to say here that, after the fall of
Montobbio and the union of Valditaro with Piacenza,
he went to the court of Farnese, where he lived for
some time. He afterwards went to Mirandola under
an escort of ducal cavalry, and waited there for brighter
days. Maria della Rovere shut herself up in the castle
of Calestano. The governor of Parma requested her
in the name of the duke to leave that residence, in
order to relieve Pier Luigi from the charge of sustaining
herself and sons. The suspicions of the imperial party
respecting the duke were about this time turned into
certainty. Cesare della Nave, of Bologna, a man of
good education who had been created ducal commissary
in Valditaro, divulged the fact that Manara had been
instructed by Pier Luigi to render all possible assistance
to Gerolamo at Montobbio. Maria then went to Rome,
and afterwards spent some time in Parma, where she
dictated her will on the 23rd of October, 1553. She
bequeathed all her property to her daughter Camilla,
wife of Nicolò Doria who afterwards as we shall see
took up the conspiracy of Gianluigi. Maria lived for
several years after the date of her will. The registers
of the notary Antonio Roccatagliata show that Camilla
only entered upon the inheritance of her mother on the
26th of September, 1561.</p>

<p>As for Panza, we find in some old manuscripts, for
which we are indebted to the courtesy of the learned
Baron Giacomo Baratta, that about 1550, he was archpriest
in the parochial church of Rapallo. Probably
the preceptor of Gianluigi, after the destruction of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
master’s family, retired to some spot secluded from
political tumults and ended his days in the practice of
those virtues which adorned his previous life.</p>

<p>The memory of Eleonora wife of Gianluigi has been
blackened by recent accusations. After the death of
her husband, beside herself with grief she threw herself
into the arms of her mother. The Strozzi papers
contain a petition addressed by her to Charles V. in
which she sets forth that her dower was secured upon
the feud of Cariseto, and prays that the emperor may
command Gonzaga to deliver it to her with all its
appurtenances in satisfaction of her claims against the
estate of Gianluigi Fieschi. Perhaps she did not obtain
her request; for we learn from confused notices that
she did not recover her dower for some years after
when she invested it in the bank of St. George.</p>

<p>Some years after Gianluigi’s death, she married
Chiappino Vitelli. Her husband was the son of that
Nicolò who was killed by Braccolini for stabbing his
own wife, Gentilina, while she lay in bed beside him.
Chiappino was a brave soldier and a captain of some
repute. He was a friend of Cosimo, followed the
fortunes of the empire and received for his warlike
virtues the investiture of Cetona with the title of
marquis. He distinguished himself in the affair of
Pignone with the Moors, in the liberation of Malta
from the siege of the Turks, in Flanders and in Holland.
Phillip II. gave him the principal charge of the last
named war. He was at this time of monstrous
obesity, and having received several wounds had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
carried in a palanquin to visit his trenches. While
making the round of his work the Bisogni, who fretted
at being commanded by an Italian, threw him down
into the foss, (1575). On receiving intelligence of his
death, Eleonora gave up her life to pious duties, and
entered the convent of the Murate in Florence, a
foundation noted for the illustrious women who fled to
it for peace, some of whom were members of her own
family.</p>

<p>We find evidence that she lived in the same cell
which had sheltered Caterina Sforza Riario&mdash;the heroic
mother of the heroic Giovanni of the black bands&mdash;until
new were constructed for her at her own expense.
She ended her days here in 1594, and Alberico I.,
prince of Massa and Carrara caused her mortal remains
to be placed, with an appropriate inscription, beside
those of her aunt Catterina, widow of Gio. Maria
Varano Duke of Camerino, who with a courage more
than manly sustained the siege of her castles by Mattia
Varano.</p>

<p>The name of Eleonora was rendered immortal not
only by her love of letters, but also by her splendid
charities, of which the Monte di Pietà of Massa is a
living monument.</p>

Luca Fieschi and his career.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">The</span> cause of the empire vacillated in Germany, and
the defeat of Chiusa followed the rout at Lorene.
Charles barely escaped the grasp of the elector of
Saxony, and retreated ill in mind and worse in body
to Villach in Carinthia. The Duke of Alba and Doria
put forth extraordinary exertions to provide him with
money and reënforcements, and Doria’s solicitude for
the empire brought new calamities upon the Republic.
When his ships were absent in the imperial service,
Dragut landed at Rapallo, (July 6th, 1550) sacked the
town, killed women and children and carried off the
flower of the population. A young peasant named
Bartolomeo Magiocco, having with difficulty escaped
from the town, bethought him of the peril of his
betrothed, rushed through the crowds of pirates, entered
the house where she lay asleep, took her up in his
strong arms and bore her safely through a shower of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Mussulman bullets to the top of Mount Allegro. Other
pirates infested our waters, and our towns were so often
pillaged that the inhabitants fled into the mountains
and left the coasts deserted and uncultivated. There
was not a hamlet which escaped pillage. The Duke
of Savoy Emanuele Filiberto while fortifying Mont
Albano, Sant Opizio and Villafranca came near falling
into the hands of the Africans. A renegade Calabrian,
named Occhiali, hearing that the duke was in Villafranca,
landed the crews of several galleys at night,
surrounded the ducal residence, and awakened its
master with the roar of arms. Emanuele escaped by
a secret passage unknown to the assailants. The victor
of San Quintino could ill digest it that he had been
compelled to turn his back on a pirate. He collected
around him his pages and esquires, and the first
peasants whom he met, and assailed the Moors. They
responded with such vigour as to drive back his little
band and he himself, after fighting long with obstinate
courage, was disarmed and captured; but two Savoyard
gentlemen set him at liberty at the price of their own
captivity. Occhiali returned to his ships loaded with
booty and prisoners. We learn from the chronicle of
Miolo that the lords of Morseleto, Gusinengo and Berra
and the castellano of Valperga lost their lives in this
battle, while among the prisoners were seventy-five of
the first gentlemen of Savoy.</p>

<p>The duke mortified at his failure and particularly
that two gentlemen who had risked their lives for him
should remain in the hands of the Corsairs, was forced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
to offer as a ransom two thousand gold crowns of the
sun. The pirate required that, besides the payment
of this sum, the Duchess of Savoy should visit him
and permit him to do homage by kissing her hand.
“This,” said he, “will render me famous throughout
Europe.” Strange union of African barbarity with the
chivalry of the middle ages! The Count of Savoy
was not willing that the duchess should humble herself
in the presence of this renegade stained with the most
horrid crimes; but the prince felt deeply the misfortune
of his faithful courtiers and resorted to an artifice
which secured their liberation without humiliating the
princess. A woman having the general appearance of
the duchess was clothed in her robes, taken on board
the moorish galley and with great pomp presented to
the pirate, who fell on his knees, kissed her hand with
knightly grace, released the captives and sailed back to
Africa the happiest rover of the main.</p>

<p>While Charles was struggling with adverse fortune
in Germany and the Turkish fleets were desolating the
coasts of Italy, Ferrante Sanseverino, Prince of Salerno,
formed a league with the Duke of Somma and endeavoured
to deliver Naples from the Spanish yoke.
A conference was held with the legates of France at
Chioggia in which all those who hated the Aragonese
power participated. There were the Cardinals of
Ferrara and Tornone, Termes, Selves, the Count of
Mirandola, Cornelio Bentivoglio, Giulio Veri, and in
fine nearly all the exiles. The Cardinal of Tornone
and Termes discouraged the Neapolitan revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and the confederates turned their attention to Siena.
Venice, as in most occasions stood neutral. But Siena,
irritated by recent wrongs inflicted by imperial ministers,
took part in the conference and Count Pitigliano
abandoned the standards of Cæsar and promised to
carry the city over to the side of France. As we have
said France was to most Italians the symbol of our
independence, and whether or not she wished us
well she made copious promises, “according,” writes
Macchiavelli, “to the habit of that nation.”</p>

<p>Siena expelled Don Diego Urtado di Mendozza with
his Spanish garrison and established a free government;
but the emperor at once despatched the Marquis of
Marignano to punish the rebellion, and France sent
Pietro Strozzi to make a diversion in favour of the
city.</p>

<p>On the 16th of June, 1554, the Duke of Florence
wrote to the government of Genoa:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Your Excellencies will have learned that Pietro
Strozzi, with about four thousand infantry and three
hundred horse, is advancing to unite with the troops
of Mirandola and then to penetrate into Tuscany and
make a diversion in favour of Siena. Being resolved
to make a spirited resistance, I have sent the Marquis
of Marignano with about two thousand infantry and
seven hundred horse from my army, who will encamp
to-night at Pescia and advance to-morrow to fight the
enemy at the first good opportunity. I write to your
Excellencies, as faithful allies, to give you an account
of our proceeding and to ask you to add to our troops,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
for this emergency the one thousand Germans who are
stationed at Spezia, sending them forward direct to
Pietra Santa or embarking them for Leghorn, as shall
seem to you most expeditious. I promise you that as
soon as this affair shall be terminated, your troops
shall be returned to you with any part of my own
that you may need. I earnestly entreat your instant
coöperation in this matter, which, as you will see,
concerns our common interest and safety. Above all
act promptly for celerity is everything, as we are on
the brink of an engagement with the enemy.”</p>

<p>The Republic, forgetful of the generous sympathy
of Siena in its own straits and the solidarity of the two
peoples, granted the request of Cosimo and hastened to
prop the declining fortunes of Spain.</p>

<p>Siena was defended by the bravest Italians of that
period. Of many illustrious names it will suffice to
cite only those of Cornelio Bentivoglio, who succeeded
Termes in the supreme command, his brothers Giovanni
and Antongaliazzo&mdash;the first of whom was killed at
the battle of Marciano and the second taken prisoner&mdash;the
Orsini, Giovanni Vitelli, Adriano, Baglioni, Don
Carlo Caraffa, Count Muzio da Tolentino, Lionetto da
Todi, an Avogardo, a Martinengo, Sampiero di Bastelica
and the Genoese Aurelio Fregoso&mdash;once a captain in
the French service&mdash;and Ottobuono Fieschi. Some
other Genoese fought on the side of Spain, against the
brave city, among whom besides Doria (of whom we
shall speak presently) were Alberico Cybo Malaspina,
who commanded the troops of the Holy See. Phillip II.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
afterwards rewarded him for this service by creating
him prince of the empire and of Massa and Carrara.</p>

<p>The defence of Siena is one of the most brilliant
episodes of Italian history. The very women, led
by Laudomia Forteguerri and Faustina Piccolomini
emulated the valour of ancient times. But it was all
fruitless. Leone Strozzi was killed at Piombino, Pietro
his brother was routed at Marciano, and the city,
deprived of reënforcements by Doria, who beat off the
French fleet, was forced to yield. The remnant of the
defenders, reduced from forty thousand inhabitants to
six thousand, repaired to Montalcino where they set
up their fallen Republic.</p>

<p>The she-wolf of Siena had fallen into the jaws of
the Florentine lion, but the French troops under the
command of Flaminio Orsino, Pietro Strozzi, Port’
Ercole, Orbetello and Talamone remained to be vanquished,
and the Count Marignano moved upon them
with a strong army. Andrea Doria supplied provisions
and artillery and his forty galleys prevented the
reënforcement or retreat of the French by sea. Marignano
carried the fortress of Sant’Ippolito by storm,
and successively the castles of Avvoltojo and Stronco
fell into his hands. Chiappino Vitelli, captain in the
pay of Orsino, distinguished himself greatly at Stronco.
Strozzi found his position untenable and retired with
Orsino to Montalto, a castle belonging to the Farnese,
situated near the sea. This retreat discouraged the
friends of Siena and all the towns which had favoured
them surrendered to the imperials. At Avvoltojo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Ottobuono Fieschi was taken prisoner and delivered to
Andrea Doria. Neither his own great age, nor the
memory of his bloody vengeance against the Fieschi
family, softened the spirit of the admiral. It is enough
to make one’s heart bleed to think that he who had
often spared the lives of Turkish pirates, who treated
the inhuman Barbarossa with courtesy and released
Dragut from his chains, ordered Ottobuono to be
brought to him enclosed in a sack and barbarously
butchered before his eyes.</p>

<p>The murder of this brave warrior, captured while
fighting for national independence, deepened the resentment
in the Genoese already exasperated by the
sanguinary vengeance taken against the Fieschi and
the perversion of the Republic. Nor was Genoa alone
in opposing the Doria government; the Ligurians
generally shared the feeling of the capital and the
Corsicans, suffering under the despotism of our nobles,
began to show signs of revolt.</p>

<p>Fregoso and Sampiero shared the perils of Ottobuono
in the siege of Siena. Aurelio Fregoso and Fieschi
had laid aside their hereditary enmity at Mirandola
and set out together for the seat of war. Eleonora,
widow of Gianluigi, had sealed this new friendship by
giving in marriage to Fregoso her sister-in-law Lucrezia
Vitelli. Aurelio was a soldier of great merit and was
afterwards honoured for his valour. Siena enrolled
him among her citizens, Francesco Maria, Duke of
Urbino, invested him with the feud of St. Agata, and
Cosimo himself treated him as an intimate friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>Sampiero, Fregoso’s companion in the vicissitudes
of a stormy career, was the most formidable soldier and
captain of his time. The example of the Fieschi whom
he had known in Rome, Mirandola, Siena and France,
led him to draw his sword against the Genoese government;
and therefore we may be permitted to touch
upon the overthrow of his family in a struggle which
dyed his native rocks with Genoese blood.</p>

<p>Sampiero was born in humble fortune at Bastelica
(whence his surname), and having studied the military
art in his youth left his native island and went to
Rome. Here, none excelled him in strength and
courage. There is a tradition that an Orsini wished
to deprive him of this honour and for the purpose
challenged him to a joust with a wild bull. The young
and reckless Samperio accepted the contest and cut
down his ferocious antagonist. He served successively
the Florentines against Pisa and the king of France.
In the latter service his exploits in Catalonia and
Provence raised him to high reputation. The famous
defiance of Barletta is far less entitled to fame than his
great duel at the battle of Perpignano; but what great
Italian writer has preserved the memory of that deed?</p>

<p>On the evening of the tenth of October 1542, five
hundred Spanish knights issued from Perpignano with
flying colours, and challenged the besieging army to
fight them man for man. Sampiero heard the defiance
and collected about him some of his bravest knights,
among whom were Pecchia da Borgo, Francesco da
Verona, Ceccone da San Zenese, Bartolomeo da Fano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
and other Italians to the number of fifty. He led this
little band to the tent of Delfino the French general,
and obtained permission to put his fifty against the
five hundred Spaniards. The French barons were
astonished at his audacity, but Sampiero without
waiting to hear their objections dashed down upon the
Spaniards with such impetuosity as to hurl them backward
at the first shock. In endeavouring to retire the
vanquished knights broke their ranks and fell into a
confusion which enabled the victors to kill many and
capture a larger number without the loss of a man.</p>

<p>After this victory, which would be memorable in
any age, the Italians returned to their tents, where the
Marshal of France received them with great honour,
the flower of his knights greeting them with trumpets
and acclamations. Delfino received them one by one
and gave them rich presents&mdash;especially Sampiero, to
whom he gave a rich gold chain.</p>

<p>The fame which he had acquired obscured the
memory of his humble birth, and he was counted
worthy to espouse Vannina, daughter and heir of
Francesco, Marquis of Ornano. He served afterwards
in the French army of Piedmont and Paul III. received
him at his court with every mark of affection, when
after the death of Pier Luigi he was collecting men
and captains to avenge the assassination.</p>

<p>The Genoese, suspecting intrigues between the Fieschi
and the Pope, seized Sampiero and he only recovered
his liberty after urgent solicitations of France in his
behalf. This imprisonment filled him with indignation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
and he resolved to revolutionize Corsica. He landed
in the island, under the protection of French and
Turkish fleets, at the head of a fine body of Italian
soldiers and in a few days wrested it from the Genoese,
who had lost the affection of the people by extortion
and robberies under the name of imposts collected by
bands of thieves called tax and excise officers. The
Genoese government again erred by refusing friendly
offers made by France. Termes, before moving to the
support of the Corsicans, prayed the Republic to ally
itself with France on terms which would preserve its
independence, and he pledged himself in this case to
suppress revolt in Corsica. The influence of Doria was
powerful enough to secure the rejection of this proposition,
and though he was eighty-six years of age he,
with Agostino Spinola for colleague, undertook to crush
the rebellion. Both parties fought with equal valour;
but the siege of Siena called Doria from the Island to
the coast of Tuscany, and Termes had not a sufficient
force to conquer the Ligurian power in Corsica.</p>

<p>At that time, Count Scipione Fieschi lived in the
court of Catherine de’ Medici, regent of the kingdom
of France. The Republic sent there Tobia Pallavicini
and Gerolamo Lomellini, under pretence of promoting
amicable relations with that crown, but in reality to
intrigue against the Fieschi. But Catherine who had
induced Henry II. to insert in the treaty of Castel
Cambrese stipulations in favour of the family, had not
changed sympathies and, instead of yielding to the
influence of the Genoese ambassadors, opened negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
for the restoration of Scipione to his ancestral
rights.</p>

<p>Finding the Republic utterly averse to her wishes,
she conceived a strong animosity against it, and supported
the movements of the Fieschi and other exiles
with a vigour which must have produced great results,
if the peace with Spain and the Huguenot war had not
recalled all her attention to home affairs.</p>

<p>Sampiero was one of the warmest friends both of the
Fieschi and the Queen regent, and discontented with
peace he incessantly stimulated the exiles to some noble
enterprise. Leaving his wife in Marseilles, he visited
the courts of Italy and Navarre, and even sailed into
Africa to solicit the coöperation of the Turks. He
visited the court of Soliman, who, struck with his
valour, loaded him with presents and dismissed him
with flattering promises.</p>

<p>The Republic was on the alert and took measures to
thwart the schemes of the exiles. Poison and daggers
had failed, and the Dorias invented another expedient.
Sampiero returning from the East learned that his wife
Vannina, under the influence of priest Michelangelo
Ombrone and Agostino Bacigalupo, had sailed for
Genoa. These messengers had been suborned by the
Genoese government to decoy Vannina into Genoa
under pretence that she might recover the confiscated
feud of Ornano and obtain her husband’s pardon, for
whose head the Senate had offered a reward of five
thousand crowns.</p>

<p>This news inflamed Sampiero with the greater wrath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
that it was likely to create the belief that she went
there by his advice and so to injure his fellow exiles.
He lamented his misfortune to Pier Giovanni da
Calvese, who had been the companion of his journey
into the East, and Calvese informed him that he had
known the fact for some days, but had concealed it lest
he should share the fate of Florio da Corte, whom
Sampiero had killed.</p>

<p>Sampiero was so angry that he ran his companion
through and left him dead on the spot. On arriving
at Marseilles, he learned that the Queen had sent
Antonio San Fiorenzo in chase of Vannina, and that
she had been overtaken at Antibo and confined in the
castle of Zaisi near Aix. Sampiero started at once for
the castle with the intention of taking his wife under
his own care, but the Count of Provence fearing that
he would do her mischief left her to choose her own
course. The magnanimous woman did not hesitate a
moment to put herself entirely in the power of her
husband.</p>

<p>He was mortally wounded by the suspicion of the
Corsicans that her voyage to Genoa had been a treachery
of his own, and he had no means of exculpating himself
but by taking vengeance for the crime on the
person of the offender. But he loved Vannina passionately
and for some days patriotism and affection
contended for the mastery in his bosom. But Vannina
knew his perplexity, and came to his relief by imploring
death at his hands. She gathered about her the
servants of her household and her younger son Antonfrancesco<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
(Alfonso was in the French court) and
addressing her husband in passionate terms, she said:
“kneel before me, and show to these persons that you
still love me, that I am worthy of you. Call me donna,
Madonna.” Sampiero comprehended her thought and
fell at her feet covering her hands with tears and kisses.
Then they entered into a private apartment, and what
passed between them there is known only to God. The
servants heard sighs, sobs, kisses; then a shriek followed
by a deep silence. Sampiero mounted his horse and
rode swiftly to Paris. By killing Vannina he satisfied
the Corsicans of his fidelity, and more, that no affection
could withhold him from punishing the guilty.</p>

<p>The hatred of Sampiero to the government of Genoa
was doubled by the part it had played in this tragedy
of his domestic life. He obtained the permission of
the French Queen to undertake the war of Corsica, and
formed friendship among the Genoese exiles who shared
his views, “especially,” says Osino, “with a Gerolamo
Fieschi and Cornelio Fregoso. The latter used every
argument and artifice to entice Cosimo to favour the
enterprise and even attempt it in his own name and
interest.” Cosimo temporized; and Sampiero, little
accustomed to count up obstacles or enemies, passed
into Corsica with only two ships and a few companions.
One asked him:&mdash;“In case your ships should be lost,
in what could you trust for safety?” Sampiero replied:
“I trust only to my sword.”</p>

<p>He seized the castle of Istria, routed the Genoese at
Corte, and Terra del Commune, opened its gates to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
little band. It would be long to recount all the battles
which he fought against trained troops, always winning
victories. The battles of Vescovado and Pietra di
Caccia kindled a general revolution in the island. In
the last, the Genoese killed were more than three
hundred, and they lost many more as prisoners.
Among the latter Sampiero found a Giovanni Battista
Fieschi (of the Savignone branch) and, instead of
treating him as a conquered enemy, entertained him
with friendly courtesy in memory of kindness done
him by the Fieschi in France. In fact the Fieschi had
never refused him any favour; and when he sent
Leonardo da Corte and Anton Padovano da Brando to
Paris, in quest of aid, Scipione Fieschi had induced
the Queen to give twelve thousand crowns and some
troops.</p>

<p>The Fieschi favoured Sampiero because they believed
trouble abroad would render revolution easier at home.
The energy and valour of this warrior would have
given the Republic infinite trouble, if treachery had
not interrupted the progress of his brilliant vengeance.
Though the forces of the senate in Corsica were large
and had been reënforced by German and Spanish
infantry, they seemed powerless before the revolution.
Two causes rendered them impotent; the desperate
ardour of the islanders goaded to madness by the
agents of the Bank of St. George, and the absence of
the popular element in the Genoese administration.
A people unaccustomed to arms, removed from all
share in the government, and jealously watched by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
dominant oligarchy, is not apt to rush enthusiastically
upon death in defence of the power of a few patricians.
Finding the war going constantly against them, the
senators resolved to send into Corsica Stefano Doria,
Lord of Dolceaqua, and they expected him to sink the
rebellion in a deluge of fire. He was indeed a man
of extraordinary military talents, and his ferocity was
still greater. Charles V. prized his soldierly qualities,
and Phillip II. created him colonel and knight of St.
James of Campostella. Emanuele Filiberto, also, of
whom he was a feudatory, covered him with honours,
made him councillor and captain-general, and entrusted
him with the defence of Nice against the Turks. He
acquired distinction in the battles of Ceresole and
Cuneo, and this induced the Republic to select him for
the Corsican war.</p>

<p>He accepted the appointment with great confidence,
and swore to exterminate the whole Corsican people.
He said:&mdash;“when the Athenians captured the city of
Melas, after a siege of seven months, they butchered
all the inhabitants over fourteen years of age and
repopulated the island. The Corsicans merit a like
punishment, and we should imitate the example. Such
vigour prepared the Athenians for the conquest of the
Pelopenesus, Greece, Africa, Sicily and Italy; and only
by exterminating their enemies did they acquire glory
for their arms. I know it will be said that such
severity violates the rights of peoples and the laws of
humanity; but why listen to such follies? I only ask
that they shall be made to fear us, and, in comparison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
with the applause of Genoa, I despise the judgment of
posterity to which the simple appeal.”</p>

<p>On these principles, Doria burned and devastated
half the island, but he did not conquer Sampiero. The
conspirator in brief pauses of the battle, assembled the
people in Bozio and laid the foundations of a Republic
in the fashion of that of Sambucuccio di Alando.
Doria was recalled; Vivaldi and Defornari who followed
him accomplished nothing of moment.</p>

<p>The senate, despairing of victory in war, resorted to
plots against the life of Sampiero. He was riding one
day with his son Alfonso towards the castle of Rocca,
when Raffaele Giustiniani, assailed him with a band
of horsemen. Among the assailants, were some Corsicans
who had deserted Sampiero, particularly Ercole
da Istria and three brothers Ornano. They attacked
him in a disadvantageous position in the valley of
Cavro; but Sampiero told his son to save himself by
flight and plunged into the thick of his enemies. He
prostrated Gian Antonio Ornano with the fire of his
arquebus, and was grappling with his enemies when
he was killed by a musket ball in the shoulder. It
was believed that Vittolo, his esquire, corrupted by the
Genoese general, fired the fatal shot. His death did
not dishearten the Corsicans; they fought two years
longer under Alfonso, then only seventeen years of age.
But finally both parties grew tired of the war and
terms of accommodation were settled. The exiles now
lost all hope of recovering their country.</p>

<p>Though the Fieschi and their partisans were dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and Count Scipione disinherited, it is not probable that
Andrea Doria forgot that Pier Luca Fieschi had advised
Gianluigi to form an alliance with France; but perhaps
others anticipated him in that part of his vengeance.
We have seen that Paul III., having given his niece in
marriage to Ferrero, invested him with the Marquisate
of Masserano which belonged to Fieschi. The latter,
indignant at this robbery, ceased to pay the annual
tribute to the Pope for Crevacuore. Paul, for this,
and, says the papal brief, “Also for falsifying money
in his unlawful mints and other crimes,” condemned
him, deprived him of his feud and gave it also to
Ferrero. But neither the sentence, papal briefs or
excommunications sufficed to expel Pier Luca from his
castle, which he afterwards sold to the Duke of Savoy,
(1548.) The duke took an oath that neither he nor
his descendants would cede the whole or any part of
the county of Fieschi to Ferrero or any person of his
race. Gregory XIII. absolved him from this oath, and
in spite of Pier Luca the feud reverted to Basso Ferrero
and Clement XVII. erected it into a principate.</p>

<p>We do not know how Pier Luca died; but the
manuscripts we consult speak of his end as miserable.
Almost all the Fieschi patrimony in Piedmont fell into
the power of the Ferrero, who treated their subjects
with a severity which strikingly contrasted with the
paternal government of their old masters and led to
many seditions and revolts. Urban VIII., moved by
the loud complaints of the people, deprived Prince
Filiberto, son of Basso, of his entire state, and his son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
also named Basso, was only permitted to assume the
government through the interposition of Duke Feria
and Victor Amedeus II. We have before us a letter
of the latter, dated January 23rd, 1632, urging the
people of Crevacuore to accept Basso “who is not
responsible for the faults of his brother and father.”
But the new Basso was no better than the old.
Alexander VII. removed him from the government
and ordered the destruction of the two fortresses of
Masserano and Crevacuore. Here we pause; for the
history of these feuds is no longer within the range
of our subject.</p>

<p>The Doria and imperial faction did not rest while
one of the Fieschi conspirators breathed the vital air.
Even Giulio Pojano, who commanded the galleys of
Gianluigi, fell into snares set for him by that party.
He was accused of plotting against the life of Fulvia
da Coreggio, wife of Count Lodovico Mirandola, arrested
by her orders and strangled in prison.</p>

to the year of his death&mdash;The causes of his arrest and punishment&mdash;He
was not guilty of the vices ascribed to him&mdash;The

condemnation was his Protestant opinions.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">A Painful</span> episode of literary history is closely connected
with the Fieschi conspiracy, and it has not yet
been fully described. If that Bonfadio, with whose
name the reader of these pages has grown familiar,
the Bonfadio who was condemned for infamous crimes
to an infamous punishment, was indeed an innocent
man, the fact is one of great importance. We are able
to add something to the history of this foreign<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> writer
of Ligurian story whose fate illustrates that maxim
which affirms:&mdash;The causes of great events are always
imperfectly known; because those who are close at
hand know only so much as persons whose interests
require concealment of the truth choose to tell; and
those who are distant interpret facts by passion,
interest, caprice or previously formed opinions.</p>

<p>Genoa was the first Italian commune in which
history was written by persons whom the government
appointed for that purpose. As early as 1157, the
great Caffaro wrote the annals of his country for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
period in which he had been a witness of her acts, and
read them to the elders, who ordered that his writings
should be deposited in the archives of the city and
commissioned the chancellor of the commune to continue
the history. This was done down to 1264, and
special additions were subsequently made embracing
a period of thirty years. The increasing rudeness
of the times, civil commotions in the city and frequent
changes in the form and personnel of the government,
arrested the progress of the annals near the close
of the thirteenth century. Paolo Partenopeo revived
the work in 1528. The senate appointed him to read
rhetoric, especially the works of Aristotle on government,
“because,” says Partenopeo, “politics should be
publicly taught in a free city.” He wrote the annals
of Genoa, and Bonfadio succeeded him in the same
office.</p>

<p>Bonfadio was born in Gorzano, near Brescia, and led a
life of vicissitudes and suffering. He was secretary to
Cardinal Bari in Rome and afterwards served Cardinal
Ghinucci. Beset with many misfortunes, which are
unconnected with our subject, he wandered to Naples,
Venice and elsewhere, and finally through Count
Martinengo was invited to Genoa as a public reader
of Aristotle. In Genoa his fate seemed to change,
and he wrote cheerfully of his pleasant sojourn and
especially of the gentle dames of our city. “It seems
to me,” he says, “that even the Turkish female slaves
entitle Genoa to be called the city of love.”</p>

<p>He lived long with Stefano Pinelli and was on terms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
of intimacy with Azzolino Sauli. G. B. Grimaldi,
Domenico Grillo, Cipriano Pallavicini and other young
men of high birth and studious tastes. His reputation
in all branches of learning induced the senate to give
him the coveted office of public annalist from the year
1528. He entered on it with pleasure and completed
his task in a brief period; and though he laments that
the eagerness of the senate to see the work did not give
him time to clothe his narration with such a diction
as becomes history, yet in beauty of style and skill in
arrangement few Italian<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> histories can be compared
with it. We must regret that the work only comes
down to the year 1550, in which he met his unfortunate
death. In that year he was torn from his studies
and his friends and condemned to the flames; and
though many gentlemen laboured with the greatest
earnestness to save him, on the 19th of July he was
beheaded in prison (this his friends secured as a favour)
and his body was committed to the flames. We find
the record in the books of the condemned kept by the
<i>Compagnia della Misericordia</i>.</p>

<p>Casoni erred, therefore, in stating that he was
executed in 1582, as also Tuano who fixes it in 1560,
in which he is followed by Konning and Bayle. Nor
less inaccurate are Pagano Paganini, Cesare Caporale,
Chevalier Marini, Scipione Ammirato and Crescimbeni
who tell us that he died by fire, since his body was
only burned after death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>We know that the <i>Biblioteca Civica</i> of Genoa
contains some rhymes of an ascetic character which
are usually attributed to Bonfadio, at the end of which
a marginal note says that he died in prison July 20th,
1561. This raised doubts about the year of his death
and some have argued that he was not beheaded at all
but died a natural death. A little experience in reading
ancient manuscripts will enable any one to see at a
glance that this note belongs to a period much later
than the sixteenth century. Nor can that record by
an unknown amanuensis be compared for authenticity
with the catalogue of the condemned kept by the
<i>Compagnia della Misericordia</i>. We pass over the
rhymes. Except a few sprightly lines, they show the
devoted ardour of a monk rather than the philosophic
penetration and chaste diction of Jacopo.</p>

<p>The cause of his severe punishment was from the
beginning involved in obscurity, and the lapse of
centuries has seemed to increase rather than dissipate
the darkness. He has been accused of dishonourable
and illicit love and of having disclosed state secrets.
Others tell us that powerful rivals in love caused his
ruin, and still others that he had incurred the enmity
of powerful families who instigated his arrest and
condemnation. His biographers give us no light;
rather they increase the confusion. But the opinion
has prevailed that he was executed for illicit amours.
The writers who maintained this opinion were of no
great weight, and it is time to show the inconclusiveness
of their judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The statutes of Genoa attached the penalty of death
to the crimes of Attic venery, heresy and witchcraft,
for one of which Bonfadio must have been punished.
No one accuses him of the last two. Tuano, who is
quoted among those who charge him with lustful
crimes, says nothing clearly but only that “Bonfadio
was punished for an offence which it is prudent to
conceal” (<i>ob rem tacendam</i>). But, besides that many
things are better concealed, it is important to remember
that Tuano, who did not even know the year
in which Bonfadio was executed is a suspected authority
in Italian affairs. Paolo Manuzio leaves us in equal
uncertainty; in his golden Latin song he says that
Bonfadio perished for a crime over which the sword of
justice could not slumber, but he does not define the
singular offence which he also says would not tarnish
the glory of his name. The only one of his contemporaries
who openly accuses him is the base Marini,
whose verses, worshipped both by princes and the
populace, invested falsehood with the appearance of
truth. Cardano took up the tale and no one has yet
destroyed the basis of the calumny. The judicious and
impartial critic knows how little value is to be attached
to any statement by Cardano; nor can a verse of the
author of the Adonis be accepted as a guide for the
opinions of posterity, especially since Garuffi has so
severely criticized him for traducing the memory of so
great a writer as Bonfadio.</p>

<p>One must know little of the low morals of an age
which put a price upon sin and absolved offences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
before they were committed, to doubt that the vice with
which Bonfadio is charged prevailed to a fearful extent.</p>

<p>Genoa, though she had the forms of a Republic, was
no better than the rest of Italy. Let us admit then,
for a moment, that Bonfadio fell into the common sin.
It was neither so new nor scandalous to the senate as
to have led to his death by fire. Such a charge was in
the sixteenth century little less than ridiculous. We
have gone over many volumes of the criminal <i>Ruota</i>
of the time, and, though we have studied diligently,
we find not a single case of severe punishment for that
crime. Whether no cases are found because proofs of
such beastly crimes are difficult to find, or because the
vice was universal, is hard to decide. We find that a
Francesco Spinola called the <i>Caboga</i>, who was brutally
addicted to the vice was, not burned, but sent to the
frontiers a few years after the death of Bonfadio.
Though in 1479, a master workman in coral, who had
violated a girl in Albaro was quartered with red hot
irons, the severe sentence was not for the rape, but
because he had afterwards killed his victim. It is not
probable then that the government was severe against
so common a crime, or would have condemned to the
flames for it a man of such talent and position as
Bonfadio. Had this been his only offence, his numerous
friends in the senate would have encountered little
difficulty in saving his life. Andrea Doria so lauded
in Bonfadio’s immortal pages, who controlled all the
affairs of the Republic, whose will was mightier than
law, would have saved him from death. We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
therefore believe that the blow which felled him came
from a higher hand than Genoese law, from a hand
with which it was idle to contend. This conclusion
will help us to find elsewhere the true cause of his
condemnation.</p>

<p>The most credible authorities of the time tell us that
he was innocent of these vices, and they add that he
suffered for secret reasons of state. Some even among
these writers seem to have been borne down by current
opinion and doubt if he were not guilty, but they add
that it was only the pretext for his punishment. Such
is the opinion of Giammatteo Toscano who wrote indignant
verses against the Genoese for the murder of
Jacopo. Caporali declared Bonfadio innocent. Ottavio
Cossi and Ghilini tell us that having offended in his
writings some very exalted persons, he was accused of
infamous ardours. It is probably true that he incurred
the enmity of illustrious families whose names were
blackened in his history; Zilioli confirms this theory
when he says that Bonfadio’s history was <i>mortal</i> to its
author. Boccalini states the case with much greater
clearness, blaming the pen of Bonfadio for having
impeached the honour of great houses, adding that an
historian should imitate vine-dressers and gardeners:
that is to say, should speak only in the full maturity
of events, when the great who had done evil are dead
and their children incapable of vengeance. He enforces
his theory by the example of Tacitus who preferred
violating the laws of history to running risk of personal
danger. In expressing these cowardly sentiments (an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
historian ought to tell the truth and to throw down
his pen when that becomes impossible) Boccalini did
not express his true opinions, and he was afterwards
run through by the Spanish ambassador in Venice for
writing freely against Spain.</p>

<p>Laying aside as untenable the opinion of Marini and
Cardano, we agree with those who deny that Bonfadio
had fallen so low, and we find support in the testimony
of Ortensio Landi, a contemporary of our author and
a man of great talents, who fell into disgrace at Rome
for evangelical opinions. He tells us that Bonfadio
was condemned on false testimony; and this was the
belief of the learned of that period. There is in fact
nothing to support the theory that he was guilty except
the assertions of writers of little reputation for truth in
other matters, who were, indeed, only servile retailers
of calumnies which their authors wished perpetuated
beyond the tomb. The nature of the penalty, the secrecy
of the trial and the position of the accused were calculated
to impress the popular mind with the belief in a
crime against nature&mdash;a crime which famous examples,
especially that of Brunetto Latini, showed to be the vice
of <i>literary men and public teachers of youth</i>. There
is, besides, in man an instinct which finds guilt where
the axe falls. The public and the historians forgot
one fact, Bonfadio read his lectures in a church and
his auditors were not young boys. He says that he
had “many aged listeners and more merchants than
Students.”</p>

<p>The true cause of his condemnation must be sought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
in his <i>Annals</i>. He probably blamed pretty freely
some persons who expected great praise. This opinion
is adopted by Teissier among foreign writers, and in
Italy by Fontanini and Mazzucchelli besides those
already mentioned.</p>

<p>A careful reading of Scipione Ammirato will show
that he really does not differ from these writers. “He
was punished,” says Ammirato, “for teaching political
principles contrary to those of his time and place,”
although Bonfadio supported the Doria and Spanish
party and opposed those who fought for more liberal
government.</p>

<p>We must now enquire what persons offended by the
bias of Bonfadio were sufficiently powerful to satiate
their vengeance in his blood?</p>

<p>The times were unpropitious to literary freedom.
Offences of the pen were punished by the dagger or by
banishment. Boccalini was assassinated in Venice;
Sarpi fell under a stiletto aimed by Rome. Oberto
Foglietta was banished from Genoa, and if the government
could have put hands on him he might have
gone to the scaffold. Every independent writer was
the target of powerful malevolence. So fell Bonfadio.
In describing the conspiracy of Gianluigi Fieschi, he
used unmeasured terms of reproach against that noble
family and praised beyond all limit the Dorias and the
Spanish government. His treatment of the Fieschi,
whose fate nearly all lamented and who still had
powerful friends in the Senate, provoked the vengeance
of the partisans of Gianluigi and popular liberty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
also of those nobles who were hostile to Doria and
Spain. All other attempts to avenge the dead had
failed, and they turned fiercely upon the historian who
had outraged the memory of the vanquished. They
charged him with a crime which must be punished by
fire and secured his condemnation.</p>

<p>Nor did the rage of his enemies cease with his death;
for they made every exertion to prevent the publication
of his <i>Annals</i>; and, though the times were quiet and
the Doria interest clamoured for the publication, their
enemies kept the work locked up in the public archives.
It was not published until 1586, (in Pavia by Gerolamo
Bartoli) that is thirty-six years after the death of its
author. Though Bayle and Papadopoli assert that
Bonfadio himself published it, this statement must be
put down among the numerous errors of his biographers.</p>

<p>We have seen what was the probable reason for the
attack of Bonfadio’s enemies; it remains to investigate
the pretext which they put forth, since the charge of
Attic venery cannot be entertained. Two other crimes
were punished among us by fire; and as there is no
ground for supposing him accused of witchcraft or
magic, we are forced to conclude that he was charged
with holding the new religious doctrines which were
then striking root in Italy. This opinion, so diverse
from that hitherto held, may seem bold and we will
briefly consider its probability.</p>

<p>It is well known that the revival of letters paved
the way for religious reform. It is known, too, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
Italy, seeing herself deprived of political liberty, turned
her attention to religious freedom as the foundation of
free institutions. In fact, the reformers among us
sought mainly to restore democracy to the church.
The first accents of religious liberty were heard on the
banks of the Verbano and the teachers were Bernardino
Ochino da Siena and Pietro Martire. Lucca, Pisa,
Vicenza and Modena embraced the new doctrines, and
Ferrara received as a guest in 1535, Calvin, the friend
of Renata.</p>

<p>In the court of this duchess, were found the most
distinguished of the reformers, among whom were Celio
Secondo Curione and the beautiful Olimpia Morato, a
miracle of virtue and wisdom. The religious community
of Naples contained no less illustrious disciples
all of whom belonged to the highest families of the land.
Some maintain that Vittoria Colonna, Marchioness of
Pescara, was of the number; Giulia Gonzaga and
Isabella Manriquez certainly were; the latter found
an asylum among the Lutherans. It is believed that
Princess Lavinia della Rovere, of the house of Urbino,
and Margaret of Savoy, wife of Emanuel Filiberto,
embraced the new doctrines.</p>

<p>In those days the most cultivated Italians professed
the boldest doctrines. Vasari tells us that Leonardo
da Vinci had formed such heretical opinions that he
accepted no religion whatever. Castelvetro, accused
of heresy, with great difficulty escaped the grasp of the
inquisition. Bishop Pietro Paolo Vergerio and his
brother Giovanni Battista, whose condemnation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
written by the same pen which drew the fatal capitulation
of Forno; Guglielmo Grattarolo, Gerolamo Zanchi
a canon of the Lateran, Giovanni Montalcino, the
Sozzini of Siena, the brothers Scipio and Alberico
Gentile and many other distinguished literary men
held the views of the reformers. Paul III., appalled by
the rapid progress of the new ideas, with his bull of
April 1543, established the tribunal of the Inquisition
in every city, Venice did not wish to suffer it; but
Rome strangled Giulio Ghirlanda and Francesco
di Rovigo, and all the reformers (among them are
mentioned Trissino, Flaminio, Soranzo and Bembo)
were forced to flee into exile.</p>

<p>Many noble men fell in Rome; Fannio Aonio
Paleario and the Venitian Algieri. The church was
saved by sword and fire; and the ecclesiastical writers
agree with us in this:&mdash;It was the Inquisition that
extirpated the new doctrines in Italy; without this
intervention of force, the intellectual character of the
Italians, the well-known licentiousness of the Popes,
the habit of our poets to sport at friars and nuns, and
the denial by our republics of infallibility to the
Apostolic See, must have combined to promote the
complete triumph of the religious reform.</p>

<p>The church always had great power in Genoa. As
early as 1253, the friars of San Domenico executed a
Master Luco as a heresiarch and confiscated his goods.
The church grew so arrogant that three years later, Fra
Anselmo, chief inquisitor, demanded that certain rules
of his should be incorporated among the statutes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the Republic. The consuls refused to gratify him and
the inquisitor excommunicated the city and its district.
The government sent ambassadors to the Pope without
success; it was forced to humble itself and register on
its statute books laws dictated by a priest. In 1459,
a decree of the Republic granted every facility and
privilege to the father inquisitors.</p>

<p>The bull of Paul III. inflamed our inquisitors with
extraordinary zeal. The partisans of the new creed
were increasing rapidly, and the fathers resolved to
convert or exterminate them. Among the heretics, to
say nothing of laics, was Cardinal Federico Fregoso
whose books on the psalms had been entered in the
index. The prior of San Matteo was accused of heresy
in Bonfadio’s time and cited to appear before the
inquisition in Rome, in spite of the friendship and
protection of Doria and the government. It has never
been clearly proved that Bonfadio shared the views of
the reformers, but everything conspires to the support
of that theory. However that may be, his opinions
were certainly such as to afford his enemies a pretext
for the accusation. He hated the priests and spoke
and wrote bitterly against them. His letters, which
give him the first place in that branch of Italian literature,
show that he was opposed to all religious orders
and particularly the regular clergy called <i>Theatine</i>,
who reciprocated the sentiment and spoke of his death
as a judgment of God. His annals and the freedom
of his speech made him many other enemies in Genoa,
but though they were powerful he despised them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Carnesecchi warned him that one of them had established
himself near his person and exhorted him to be
cautious. Bonfadio replied:&mdash;“The man of whom you
write to me from the Roman court always disliked
me.... His eyebrows are shorn, and he never laughs;
wherefore I doubt that He who can do all things is
able to make the man good. He has done an evil
work, but it was his own proper work, and if he has
poisoned the fruits of my labours that was inevitable,
because he bears a serpent in his bosom.” The serpent
uncoiled himself and Bonfadio was undone. It was
not difficult for his enemies to fasten upon him the
charge of heresy, adducing as proofs his intimacy with
wicked or heretical men whom Rome had already
doomed. Among the first-class was Nicolò Franco, of
Benevento, who perished on the scaffold in Rome,
prophesying the same fate for Pietro Aretina whom
that age, after loading him with honours and riches,
blasphemously called divine. Among the second class,
that is those whom the church accused of heresy, were
the Martinengo, who all belonged to the party of reform.
We may mention Ortensia Martinengo, countess
of Barco; Celso Martinengo, whose letters to Angelo
Castiglione carmelite of Genoa (written for the purpose
of converting Angelo to the new party) are extant;
Count Ulisse Martinengo who went to Antwerp as
the minister of the Italian church there when Gerolamo
Zanchi declined the appointment. Bonfadio was even
more intimate with Lord Bishop Carnesecchi who
embraced the views of Luther in the school of Vermiglio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and Ochino in Italy and of Melancthon in
France. Carnesecchi was executed in Rome in precisely
the same mode as Bonfadio in Genoa.</p>

<p>Bonfadio writing to Carnesecchi praises his divine
talents and adds:&mdash;“As the Romans preserve the statue
which fell from heaven, so may God preserve you for
the edification of many and put off to a distant day
the fading of one of the first lights of Tuscan virtue.
May God enable you to be happy and live with that
cheerfulness which characterized you when we were
together in Naples.”</p>

<p>He was also very intimate with Giovanni Valdes a
Catalan, who was among the first advocates of Luther’s
opinions. After the death of Valdes, he wrote:&mdash;“Whither
shall we turn, now that Valdes is no more?
This is a great loss for us and for Europe; for Valdes
was one of the rarest men in Europe. His writings
on the epistles of St. Paul and the psalms of David are
abundant proof of his ability. He was without controversy
a complete man in deed, word and counsel.
His little spark of soul kept alive his weak and emaciated
body; his great part, that pure intellect, as if
outside of his frame, was continually uplifted to the
contemplation of truth and divine things.”</p>

<p>These words make it highly probable that Bonfadio
held the doctrines of the man he so highly esteemed,
and show us that this friendship for the enemies of
Rome afforded sufficient ground for a charge of heresy.
This will seem very credible, when we remember that
a canon of the inquisition declared that the smallest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
evidences were sufficient for conviction of heresy; a
nod, suspicion or common report, especially in the case
of a man of letters, of whom Paleario wrote that the
inquisition was <i>sicam districtam in literatos</i> (a dagger
drawn against literary men.)</p>

<p>We conclude then that the religious views of Bonfadio
and his friendship with the reformers gave his
enemies the arms with which they slew him. The
court of Rome had its hands in the business, and by
the same act avenged its political friends, the Fieschi,
and punished a friend of the reformation. The records
of Bonfadio’s trial were never seen, and there is no
proof that the criminal <i>Ruota</i> of Genoa condemned
him. This is a new proof that the whole transaction
was the secret work of the agents of the inquisition.
The records of such a trial were not required to be filed
in the archives of the state. Nor is this all; the agents
of Rome had the right to conduct the trial without the
participation of the civil power, whose duty was to
render a blind obedience to the orders of the religious
tribunal. This explains why the Dorias who had
unlimited power over the government, were powerless
to save Bonfadio, when he was charged with holding
the opinions of the reformers, among whom we are
disposed to number him, accepting the authority of
Gerdesio a contemporary whose statement to that effect
was not contradicted in his time.</p>

<p>Whatever views our readers may entertain of the
merits of the contest between the Fieschi and Doria, it
is certain that the cruelties of the latter provoked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
reprisals by the friends of the former, and Bonfadio
the illustrious but partial historian of the conspiracy,
was one of the most conspicuous victims. As Bonfadio
succeeded Partenopeo in the office of public instruction,
Giammatteo followed Bonfadio. The Jesuits enticed
him, two years after his election, into their fraternity
and they intrigued with such success that the instructors
of our youth were chosen from their number, and
men of genius were no longer employed by the
Republic.</p>

<p>It is true that Tasso was invited to Genoa with the
offer of a liberal salary; but it was the work of private
citizens not of the government. Torquato received the
call with pleasure but he did not accept the office. In
1614, Lucilio Vanini, the Italian Spinosa, opened public
schools among us. He pursued the system of Bonfadio
with such success that many young men were affected
with heretical views and the teacher was forced to seek
his personal safety in exile. He took refuge in France;
but he was discovered and perished in the flames.
Unfortunately his doctrines had taken root among us.
To omit many, the painter Cesare Conte, the friend of
Cambiaso, Chiabrera and Paolo Foglietta, was arrested
in 1632, by the sacred office and ended his days in the
dungeon of the ducal palace.</p>

<p class="pn"><span class="smcap">It</span> is not our purpose to follow Count Scipione in his
wanderings; we shall only speak of so much of his
exile as is necessary to the narration of the last of the
Fieschi drama. He married Alfonsina, daughter of
Robert Strozzi and Maddalena de’ Medici, and obtained
many marks of esteem from the royal house of France,
whom he and Strozzi served. Elizabeth, wife of
Charles IX., treated him with the same familiarity as
Catherine de’ Medici. He distinguished himself at the
siege of Rochelle, and Henry III. knighted him in the
order of <i>Saint Esprit</i>.</p>

<p>Scipione left a son, Francesco, Count of Lavagna
and Bressuire, who fell at the head of his troops in the
siege of Monte Albano (1621), and from whose marriage
with Anna Le Veneur a noble family was born.
The eldest, Charles Leo, married Gillona de Harcourt,
(1643), who bore him Gianluigi Mario, a name which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
the Genoese Republic never forgot. Louis XIV. took
him under his protection, and demanded of the Republic
the restoration to Mario of his ancestral domains.
The Senate refused, and he sent a formidable fleet,
commanded by Segnalai (1684), who bombarded the
city, and ruined churches, monuments and palaces.
Innocent XI. interposed without effect; the fierce
monarch required that the Doge and four senators
should supplicate mercy in Paris; that the Republic
should disarm its galleys and pay a hundred thousand
crowns to Count Fieschi. The Republic abandoned by
Spain, was forced to accept these conditions, and Louis
on his part promised no longer to support the pretentions
of the Fieschi. Count Gianluigi Mario died in
1708, without offspring, and the counts of Lavagna in
the line of primogeniture ended with him.</p>

<p>We have spoken in another place of the addition to
our statutes of the law called in derision, <i>Garibetto</i>,<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
the effect of which was to exclude the new nobles and
the men of the people from political power.</p>

<p>The artifice was this: The old and new nobles in
equal numbers filled the public offices, and, the latter
being the more numerous class, the individuals of it
held the highest office less frequently than the individuals
of the old nobility. The rule was distasteful for
many reasons: it was not made in a lawful way, but
imposed by the authority of Andrea Doria, when many
of the nobles themselves (says Doge Lercaro) were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
opposed to the measure; and it was contrary to the
wishes of the vast majority that a few patricians should
have almost exclusive claims upon the Dogate.</p>

<p>The people were little pleased that they were now
totally excluded from that office, to which formerly
they alone were eligible, while the plebeians<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> fretted
at the insolence of the patricians and Spanish gentlemen
among us.</p>

<p>There were new conspiracies. The spies of the
emperor learned that a Fra Clemente of the order of
St. Francis had brought back from France some schemes
for a revolution and Suarez communicated the information
to the Senate. The friar was arrested at Ceva
and, having been tortured, he declared that De Fornari
was intriguing with the king of France to promote a
revolution in Genoa. De Fornari, the same who had
been elected Doge against the wish of the old nobles,
and who was therefore very obnoxious to that party
and idolized by the people, was captured and confined
in Antwerp.</p>

<p>Such movements led the Senate to distrust the
people more than ever and to deprive them of the right
to bear arms. In fact, when Agostino Pinelli was
Doge, Italian troops were no longer trusted with the
custody of the ducal palace; but the Republic enlisted
Swiss, German and Trentine mercenaries. Giocante
Della Casa Bianca who had commanded the guard for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
twenty-five years, gave up his sword to a German
adventurer and accepted a subordinate position.</p>

<p>Besides, though the plebeians did not revolt or renew
the conspiracies of Fieschi and Cybo, the Senate
endeavoured to ruin all those who were pronounced
friends of the ancient popular system. Oberto Foglietta
having published in Rome, where he resided (1556),
two books on the Genoese Republic, in which he exalted
the popular citizens over the patricians, declaring that
the first had served the country with greater fidelity
than the second, the government declared him guilty
of felony and punished him with banishment and confiscation
of goods. Many years after, Giovanni Andrea
Doria, to whom he dedicated his eulogies of illustrious
Ligurians, procured the revocation of the sentence.
While the Senate banished Foglietta, it praised to the
skies the ignoble treatise of Pellegro Grimaldi, who,
though a Republican, taught us to beg the favour of
princes, and the logic of Lovenzo Capelloni, who,
adhering consistently to the party of the victors,
declared that the Holy See owed its fame to the house
of Borgia.</p>

<p>On the 25th of November, 1560, Andrea Doria died,
having lived almost one hundred and one years. The
nobles called him the father of his country; but
Cosimo, the old, was equally flattered. The plebeians
with more sense surnamed Andrea <i>Good Fortune</i>,
because except in a very few cases, his plans were
always successful. He was the first admiral of his
time and conquered everybody but himself; sad proof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
of which are the misfortunes of Fieschi, Farnese, Cybo
and a long list of exalted names. He bore arms against
his country, to dissolve, he said, its alliance with
France; but the act was equally in his own interest
after he had deserted the French service.</p>

<p>If he emancipated us from France, he took away the
popular franchises and established the Spanish tyranny.
He did not wish the office of Doge; but being the
minister of Charles V. in Italy and the lord of the
Main, it did not become him to descend to an office of
less rank. The magnanimity of his own heart and the
temper of his fellow citizens alike forbade him to
assume the supreme power of a prince in Genoa. That
was probably destined in his mind for Gianettino, and
only the Fieschi conspiracy saved us from that fate.
If Doria had wielded his sword and shed his blood for
Italy as he did for foreign masters, he might perhaps
have saved us three centuries of humiliation. Foglietta
proposed to him a more generous service; to despoil
himself of galleys, giving them or selling them to the
Republic&mdash;an example which other citizens would
imitate&mdash;so that Genoa, having fifty ships in her service,
could hold French and Spaniards at bay and use the
seas for her commerce. Such a course would have
given Andrea the glory of Ottaviano Fregoso, who by
destroying the forts of the Faro, showed that he loved
his country better than his personal dignity and
interest. But the Republic saw in her waters a fleet
which belonged to her sons, while she lacked ships to
protect her coasts from the pirates of Barbary. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
splendid scheme of Foglietta came to nothing; Andrea
spent his life in keeping the seas open for French and
Spaniards and in maintaining foreign powers. He
preserved to Genoa the name of independence, but it
was a mockery. Though he put on our necks the yoke
of Spain, he was great and strong enough to be the
only minister and agent of that power.</p>

<p>A great soldier in the service of the enemies of Italy,
he stripped the Republic of her popular power, founded
an oligarchy on the ruins of liberty and closed the
glorious epopee of Genoese conquests in an endless
succession of domestic conspiracies and political contentions.
Such is our estimate of Andrea. We believe
that now that the angry passions which his actions
evoked have ceased to glow, the sentence of history
should be written with impassable justice. After his
death, the Fieschi party again took courage. They
attempted to remove the old nobles from power and
in 1560 (writes Doge Lercaro) conferences were openly
held in many places, especially in the house of Basadonne,
so that it was necessary to refer the matter to
the Senate. Finally, the nobles of San Pietro, headed
by Matteo Senarega, a man of much legal learning
and political experience whom the arrogance of Doge
Gianotto Lomellini had driven from the secretaryship
of state, resolved to renew the Fieschi movement,
humble the patricians and destroy the Spanish power.
The contest began in the election of Doge, each party
wishing to elect one of their own number, and they
came to blows. The Porch of St. Luca was supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
by its large army of vassals, by the arms of Spain and
by the galleys of Prince Giovanni Andrea Doria. The
porch of St. Pietro had the support of the populace
who hoped to regain their old place in the political
system of the Republic. In the midst of the quarrel
(1572) Galeazzo Fregoso arrived with two large triremes,
and after an enthusiastic reception by the people
announced that the king of France would give support
to the popular cause.</p>

<p>Scipione Fieschi also repaired two ships in order to
support the revolution. But both found an invincible
repugnance in the people to a revolution supported by
foreign arms, and relinquished the enterprise. The
people trusting in their own stout arms, revolted under
the leadership of Sebastiano Ceronio, Ambrosio Ceresa
and Bartolomeo Montobbio, sons of the people. However,
the life and soul of the insurrection was Bartolomeo
Coronato, who though noble by birth, patriotically
espoused the popular cause. They occupied the city,
closed the streets with barricades and shut up the
patricians in their houses. These movements lasted
for a month, the deputies of the people demanding
that the laws of 1547 be abolished and the most worthy
of the citizens inscribed in the book of gold. The
Doge trembled at the audacious demand and the Senate
saw no escape from its perplexity until Giovanni
Battista Lercaro entered the hall and said:&mdash;“Since
you have not been able to save the country from its
peril and are ignorant of the art of governing, yield
your places to better men. Elevated to your offices by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the spirit of faction and personal interest, you are unfit
to rule.”</p>

<p>These words of Lercaro, a man of great dignity and
a noble of the porch of San Luca, frightened the Senate
who promptly declared their willingness to follow his
advice. But the plebeians always generous to their
own hurt, answered:&mdash;“We have not taken arms for
political power. We only want the law of Garibetto
revoked.” Whereupon the Senate took fresh courage,
annulled the odious law, added three hundred families
to the nobility, abolished an unpopular excise duty
upon wine and raised the daily wages of the weavers
three soldi. The populace were satisfied and returned
to their daily duties, while the nobles of San Pietro
who had feared a popular tempest managed the movement
with so much address that they obtained complete
control of the state.</p>

<p>But the noblemen of San Luca, as indignant after,
as pusillanimous before the peril, refused to recognize
the new laws and, abandoning the city, retired first to
their castles and afterwards collected at Finale, then
in the power of Spain. Here they declared open war
against the Republic, and failing to obtain assent to
their demands by the mediation of princes and even of
the Pope, they invoked foreign arms to desolate the
country. A powerful fleet commanded by John of
Austria, brother of king Phillip, sailed into our waters.
The old nobles, knowing the hatred of our people to
Spain, required that the expedition should sail under
Ligurian colours; but this did not secure the success<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
of the enterprise. Meanwhile Giovanni Andrea Doria,
heir of the political opinions of his Grandfather as well
as his riches and rank, stormed the castles of Spezia,
Porto Venere, Chiavari, Sestri and Rapallo; and without
listening to proposals of peace proceeded to the
conquest of the western Riviera, capturing Noli and
Pietra.</p>

<p>The nobility, whose remittances from Spain came in
very slowly, was reduced to such extremities as to be
unable to continue the war. Giacomo Durazzo was
Doge. Prospero Fattinanti took his place and a compromise
was effected through the ambassadors of the
Pope, the emperor and the king of Spain assembled in
Casale in 1576. The accord of the two parties of the
nobility excluded the people from all political power.
The plebeians were enraged at this new betrayal of
their cause, and Matteo Senarega who had laboured so
hard to promote popular rights, prophesied that the
bondage of the plebeians would be eternal. He wrote:&mdash;“He
who is oppressed by a prince yields to necessity
and to destiny, with the consolation that a change of
masters may lighten his burdens; but he who sinks
under the despotism of a few, assuming the name of a
Republic, loses his disgust at the tyranny in the sound
of a word and under a sweet delusion wears his chains
for ever.”</p>

<p>The old and new nobles now intrigued with such
success as to destroy the spirit of popular liberty; and
Coronato, whom Lercaro though of the opposite faction
praises so highly, lost his head on the scaffold. On the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
other hand, Prince Giovanni Andrea Doria, who had
dyed his sword so often in the blood of his fellow
citizens, was called, “<i>Preserver</i> of the liberties of his
country.” To this day he holds that rank in history;
but our history must be re-written.</p>

<p>We have seen that the reforms of Andrea destroyed
the popular constitution, placed all political power in
the hands of the patricians, and opened the doors of
the Republic to Spanish supremacy. When the city
of Finale, exasperated by the lust and avarice of
Alfonso Del Caretto, shook off his yoke, the dispossessed
lord appealed as an imperial vassal to the Diet
of Augusta; and the emperor, far from favouring the
Republic, which had taken part in the fall of Alfonso,
decided that the marquis should be restored to his feud,
compelled Genoa to pay him for the damage he had
suffered. The Republic clamoured against the sentence,
it is true; but when a few years later Gabrielle
Della Cueva, duke of Albuquerque, and governor of
Milan, garrisoned Finale, Genoa had not courage to
oppose the measure, and suffered a foreign power to
intrench itself in the very heart of Liguria. At the
death of Marquis Francesco (1598), the line of Carretto
became extinct, and the Senate allowed Finale to pass
into the possession of Spain, who, not content with
this, assassinated Ercole Grimaldi, in order to become
master of the principate of Monaco, (1614.)</p>

<p>Conquests and wars were finished, and Genoa had
scarcely strength to keep down domestic revolt, and
resist the aggressions of immediate neighbours. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
greater part of the conspiracies which for almost a
century disturbed the dreams of our masters, had no
other object than to restore the popular constitution.
The free systems were falling throughout the Peninsula.
The people hoped when the council of Trent was
opened that it would not only correct the gross abuses
of the Papal court, but restore the church itself to its
ancient democratic forms. But when the council closed,
it was found that no innovation had been effected,
that a few vices had been forbidden; but the Church
remained a monarchy, as Gregory VII. and Innocent
III. had left it. Not content with this, the Papacy,
with its famous bull <i>In cœna domini</i> (1567), endeavoured
to attach all the powers of the world to its
triumphal car. The fall of the communes was complete,
and the Latin principle was strangled by the
monarchial and foreign element.</p>

<p>The Italian states, for the most part subject to
foreign powers, were changing into monarchies. Italy
was a province of Spain; and yet so detestable was
that power that Navagero tells us, Paul IV. never
spoke of the emperor or the Spaniards without calling
them “heretics, robbers, accursed of God, children of
Moors and Jews, offscouring of the earth,” and bewailing
the fate of Italy compelled to serve such vile
masters. Spain left such fierce antipathies behind her
that the interjection “Cursed be Spain,” came down
to our times. A wise Pope, Sixtus V., who tried to
oppose the imperial power, died by poison (1590).
For two centuries, the decrees which regulated Italian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
politics came from Madrid. Naples and Milan groaned
in chains; the lords of Mantua, Ferrara, and Parma,
gloried in their shameful bondage. Venice herself
purchased peace by ignoble sacrifices. Of Rome I do
not speak. That she was badly governed, witness the
incessant revolts of her people, the conspiracy of Benedetto
Accolti, and the obsequies of Paul IV.</p>

<p>Emanuele Filiberto, who won for Austria the battles
of San Quintino and Gravelines, consolidated with his
victories the foreign dominion; and, educated in the
school of Phillip II., he extinguished liberty in Savoy
by abolishing his states general, and bathed his valleys
with the blood of the Vaudois. The Republics of
central Italy saw their last days in the same terrible
period; Florence was in the grasp of Cosimo, Pistoia
under the guns of a fortress; Arezzo paid with her
liberties for favouring the imperial army; Lucca bought
with money and the blood of Burlamacchi a short
reprieve; Siena more generous than all others fought
to the last extremity and perished, like Saguntum,
among her own ruins. Thus while in the middle of
the sixteenth century the great nations were consolidated
which now control Europe, Italy was dying
and dying by the fault of her own sons. The treaty
of Castel Cambrese recognized and sealed the foreign
dominion.</p>

<p>From that moment, the love of letters ceased to be
a worship. The form was polished; but the spirit was
stifled. Our most illustrious artists, forced to live
upon the patronage of foreign princes, preferred the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
security of servile ease to the dignity and modesty of
true art. The money of the great seduced them to
abandon truth and the people without whom genius is
neither great nor productive. Pleasure for courtiers
was their only aim. The country was dying, but no
voice sang the hymn of death; no one gave history
those pages of heroism which save the dignity of
vanquished nations. On the contrary, Giovio with
unblushing brow eulogized his golden pen; Casa sang
in honour of the Charles V. whom he had once satirized.
Alamanni apologized to the emperor for his famous
verse saying that it is the poet’s office to lie, and Cellini
himself could write:&mdash;“I work for pay.”</p>

<p>In this general decline, the ideas of Fieschi did not
utterly die. Some generous souls continued to protest.
Let it suffice to cite Tassoni and Campanella, the last
of whom in his conspiracy against Spain was supported
not only by many barons but also by the Visir Cicala,
a Calabrian renegade (though of Ligurian descent) who
promised to land Turks in the kingdom. Nor would
we forget that some of our nobles in Genoa tried to
tear up the poisonous plant which had taken root in
the Republic; as, for example, Agostino and Francesco,
Pallavicini, Nicolò Doria, who married a sister of
Gianluigi Fieschi, and Agostino Vignolo who during
the Piedmontese wars intrigued with lord bishop
Brissac to aid the French arms.</p>

<p>But the Spanish government, which was destroying
letters and arts, struck its roots more deeply every day
and we reached such depths of degradation, we tremble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
in writing it, that the Senate issued a decree in the
Spanish language and consented that it should be used
in lectures and sermons. The plebeians, groaning
under a double slavery, sometimes appealed to Spain
against the arrogant despotism of the patricians; but
the appeal reacted against the petitioners and Doctor
Ligalupo, a man of much learning and great virtue,
was imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>In the reports of the Venitian ambassadors to the
Senate, the condition of Genoa is described in a few
fit words; Badoero writes:&mdash;“They hate the Spanish
nation as strongly as possible and matters stand thus:&mdash;the
people see only France; those in power see
only Spain, and none seem to think of the common
weal.”</p>

<p>With the loss of liberty our manners became dissolute.
Courtesans were held in honour. Imperia in
Rome. Tullia in Venice were courted by men of
genius. Catarina da S. Celso, Vanozza, Borgia and
Bianca Capello married into illustrious houses. To
speak of Liguria alone, a brief of Pope Clement VII.
to the archbishop of Genoa and the prior of S. Teodoro,
exhorts these prelates to unite with the government in
reforming the cloisters, because the nuns have become
utterly dissolute from contact with every sort of
persons. The Genoese nuns had infamous repute
throughout Italy. Bandello says:&mdash;They go where
they please and when they return to the cloister say
to the abbess “Mother, by your permission, we have
been to divert ourselves.” It seems that subterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
passages were opened between the cloisters of nuns
and friars. In our times, when the convent of S.
Brigida was torn down, in the open walls were found
skeletons of children who had been buried there as soon
as born. Cardinal Bembo justly said that “all human
vices and crimes were perpetrated in the cloisters
under cover of a diabolical hypocrisy.”</p>

<p>On the fourth of September 1551, another brief on
the corrupt morals of the convents was issued by Julius
III., but it produced no effect. Gregory XIII., in a
third brief of the first of July, 1583, made a new
attempt to correct the gross immoralities of the cloister
and the fruitlessness of his efforts is shown by the fact
that he issued another soon after. The Aragonese
license, penetrating the palace and the sanctuary,
corrupted everything exalted or sacred; and then
gradually diffused itself among the people, who had
hitherto been so virtuous that the magistracy of Virtue,
instituted in 1512, had no occasion to make regulations
in regard to popular morals.</p>

<p>Before the Fieschi insurrection extraordinary imposts
and forced loans were unknown. The customs were
collected on principles of equity. It was wonderful to
see the finances in healthful equilibrium, while the
strife of faction raged so fiercely. The city added a
fleet and an army to its forces at the cost of only four
hundred and seventeen thousand lire, and the entire
income of the government was only four hundred and
thirty-five thousand lire. Love of country and not
private interest ruled the hearts of the citizens; public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
services were either gratuitous or very slightly paid.
In 1461, the annual pay of the Doge was less than
twelve thousand lire, with three thousand more for
office and secret expenses; that of the commander of
the city guards was only four thousand lire; and other
salaries were in proportion.</p>

<p>But purity of manners disappeared when the foreign
power was consolidated, and the mechanism of the
State was altered to suit the character of our masters.
To pervert the plebeians, the Senate established the
lottery (the first in Italy) in 1550, under the name of
<i>Borse della Ventura</i> and it was so profitable to the
treasury that an impost of sixty-thousand lire was
collected from it, and the sum was increased year
by year until it reached three hundred and sixty
thousand.</p>

<p>Genoa, like Venice, committed the great error of
oppressing her dependencies with heavy imposts instead
of treating them with generous liberality. As early
as 1539, a tax of four denari was levied on every pint
of wine and it soon after increased to eight soldi on
each mezzarola. Later, that is in 1588, the duty on
salt was raised to a crown per mina. Three per cent.
was imposed on incomes, and a tax was levied on fruits,
and also on paper of which a large amount was exported
to foreign countries. These taxes were light in comparison
with the murderous taxation of our times, but
they were none the less annoying to citizens unused
to the visits of tax-gatherers. It had not been customary
to drain the money of the poor, but the rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
paid in proportion to their splendid fortunes or new
columns were opened in the bank of St. George.</p>

<p>The governors of this bank, seeing the Republic restricted
to a few families and the Ottoman power
becoming master of the seas, wisely returned to the
state (1562) Corsica, the cities of Ventimiglia and
Sarzana, with its strong castles, the burgh of Levanto
and the populous valley of Teico.</p>

<p>Our rich citizens lent their fortunes at high interest
to the government of Spain; but the industries which
had been the life of the people gradually declined.</p>

<p>In the first years of the century, Liguria was in
its most flourishing condition. The smallest hamlets
had profitable industries and trade. On the Western
Riviera, Taggia was famous for its Muscatelle wines
which Alberti says were not inferior to those of Candia
and Cyprus. The trade in them was very active.
Oneglia was prosperous, and Diana sometimes produced
twenty thousand barrels of oil in a single year.
Albenga, though its air was unwholesome (whence the
proverb of the time,) “Albenga piana, se fosse sana si
domanderebbe stella Diana,” was rich in the produce
of its fruitful soil. There was universal movement,
industry, wealth. But it was of short duration; the
new system of government dried up all the fountains
of our riches. In 1597, Genoa was reduced to sixty-one
thousand inhabitants; Savona which had once
counted thirty-six thousand citizens, in 1560 numbered
only fourteen thousand, and in 1625, the number had
fallen to eight thousand. The decrease was in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
proportion throughout the Republic. Campanella had
good cause to say to Genoa:&mdash;“Leave your markets,
your gains, your barren glories! Blush for the riches
of your citizens which contrast so terribly with the
misery of the Republic.”</p>

<p>The foreign influence slowly killed the manly virtues
of the Genoese. Italy no longer existed. We had a
corrupt people in a corrupt state. All care was given
to externals; every free thought was a crime; we were
vile and called our vileness love of peace, and our indolence,
moderation; religion had become a superstition,
and the rites of the church merely a ladder to worldly
preferment. Luxury and parade were unparalleled;
but poverty was seen through the pompous vestments.
The first born was rich, but his brothers were usurers or
celibates in the cloisters. In their vanity and degradation,
the great forgot that they had a country. Trade
seemed ignominious to our princes and nobles, and they
believed that their names at the foot of a bill of
exchange would make a bad figure in history. This
beggared many families to whom false pride closed
the paths by which their fathers had become great.
Knightly virtues disappeared; noble blood alone opened
the paths to eminence, and this was carried to such
extremes that our patricians refused to have for archbishop
Belmosto, only because his name was not in the
book of gold. They were at once proud and ridiculous.
In 1576, a Nicolò Doria became Doge and first took
the title of <i>Serenissimo</i> and severe penalties forbade
even the notaries to call other persons than nobles&mdash;however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
illustrious and wealthy they might be&mdash;by
the title <i>Magnifico</i>. The notarial profession<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> itself
was pronounced in certain cases ignoble and mechanical.
In the smaller towns the same folly prevailed. In
Ventimiglia and Finale, there were streets, porches
and walks to which the plebeians were not admitted.
Genoa was only a shadow, a pretence of a Republic.</p>

<p>Our wars and intestine struggles, our magnanimous
enterprises abroad, were succeeded by a servile tranquility.
Our masters preferred their gilded saloons to
the dust of honourable fields; they lent their money
at usurious interest, and got titles and degrading premiums
for their baseness. There were, it is true, some
naval engagements, but there were no real wars. And
this was the supreme misfortune; for long peace wastes
the strength of peoples and destroys both the habit
and the courage of noble enterprises. There lingered
among us arts, letters, wealth and trade; but the
manly virtues were extinct.</p>

<p>The foreign leprosy gradually changed the character
of our plebeians; they began to tremble before the
powerful from whom they were separated by an
immense interval. The two classes had nothing in
common but vices and the habit of servility. Universal
corruption produced great crimes and long
catalogues of malefactors were often published. Nor
was this in Liguria alone; all the provinces of the
Peninsula were involved in a common demoralization.
Assassins and robbers collected, not merely in bands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
but in armies, and desolated the country and even
the cities. They were led by trained warriors such
as Alfonso Piccolomini, Corsietto del Sambuco&mdash;who
ventured to the very gates of Rome&mdash;and Marco Sciarra
who in Calabria took the title of king. Let no one
suppose that the numerous altars, crucifixes and images
of Mary prove the piety of our ancestors. They are
witnesses for quite the contrary; in the midst of
innumerable crimes perpetrated in open day, these
religious emblems protected the citizen from the knife
of the assassin who was too superstitious to smite him
at the foot of the altar.</p>

<p>Religion was then only a superstition and a terror.
A multitude of books appeared full of the wildest
vagaries that fanaticism ever produced. For example,
there were the prophecies of S. Brigida threatening the
city with destruction! and through such follies the
cunning generation of men, who live upon hypocrisy,
mystery and the dead, amassed large fortunes. Their
instructions were idle speculations and appeals to
human fears. In those days, patrician and jesuit
intrigues collected their followers in a little church
situated in the <i>Corsa del Diavolo</i> and bound themselves
by an oath to support for public offices only
those of their own faction. An opposite faction organized,
and from their standard&mdash;a black crucifix&mdash;were
called <i>Moro delle Fucine</i>. This was the origin of
those pagan saturnalia which survive in our times
under the name of <i>Casaccie</i>.</p>

<p>Duplicity, fraud and treachery took the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
frank and fearless honesty. Entire towns were infected
with these vices like a species of leprosy. The inhabitants
of Borsonasca acquired a wide reputation
for shrewd frauds and deceptions. They understood
every sleight of hand, learned foreign tongues and
imitated them with admirable skill; they had cunning
artifices for getting other people’s purses, and they
travelled in every country in Europe. Though born
in the woods, they entered boldly the palaces of nobles
and even of princes, dressed as physicians, merchants,
bishops and cardinals. They sold charms, medicines,
false titles and privileges with such perfect art that
they often acquired extravagant wealth and high
rank.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Italy, sore wounded, did not die at once. Latin
virtue and civilization were so tenacious of life, that
whereas nations usually grow barbarous with the loss
of liberty, Italy, trodden by foreign and domestic
tyrannies, preserved a remnant of her culture, and,
though barren of political genius, adorned her sunset
with the splendours of science and art.</p>

<p>It was then that speculative philosophy achieved its
greatest triumphs among us. Pomponaceo, Telesio,
Cardano, Bruno and Campanella, precursors of Cartheusius
and Bacon, opened new roads for the progress of
the sciences. Strange, too, but true, when Italy was
perishing, she produced her greatest soldiers&mdash;soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
who led every other people but their own to victory.
The age of our prostration and servitude produced
Trivulzio, Medici, Gonzaga, Farnese, Colonna, Doria,
Spinola, Strozzi, and Orsini.</p>

<p>But Genoa, perhaps the last to die, was the first to
rise; the day came when, purified by suffering, she
found strength to avenge in a tempestuous uprising of
her people the shame of her long humiliation.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
